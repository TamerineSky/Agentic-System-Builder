# Sales Forecasting

Operational framework for day-to-day sales forecasting including forecast categories, submission workflows, accuracy measurement, and best practices for forecast discipline.

## When to Use This Skill

- Establishing forecast submission processes and cadence
- Training sales teams on forecast categories and discipline
- Managing weekly/monthly forecast calls and reviews
- Implementing forecast category definitions (Commit, Best Case, Pipeline)
- Tracking individual rep forecast accuracy
- Building forecast rollup and aggregation processes

## Forecast Categories

### Standard 4-Category Model

**Commit (90%+ Probability):**
- Rep stakes reputation on deal closing this period
- All key criteria met (economic buyer engaged, budget confirmed, timeline agreed)
- Included in external guidance to board/investors
- Compensation often tied to commit accuracy

**Best Case (70-89% Probability):**
- Likely to close but not certain
- Most criteria met, minor risks remain
- Used for internal planning but not external commitments
- Upside to commit forecast

**Pipeline (50-69% Probability):**
- Qualified opportunity, reasonable shot
- Multiple criteria met, significant work remains
- Provides visibility beyond commit + best case
- Often used for next quarter planning

**Omitted (<50% Probability):**
- Early stage or poorly qualified
- Not included in forecast rollup
- Tracked separately for pipeline coverage

## Forecast Submission Workflow

**Weekly Forecast Cycle:**
```
Monday: Reps update deal probabilities and categories in CRM
Tuesday AM: Reps submit forecast (commit, best case, pipeline) to manager
Tuesday PM: Managers review with reps, challenge optimism/sandbagging
Wednesday: Managers roll up to directors with commentary
Thursday: Directors present to VP Sales with variance explanation
Friday: Final forecast locked, communicated to finance/executives
```

**Monthly/Quarterly Forecast:**
- More rigorous review process
- Deal-by-deal validation of commit category
- Written justification required for large deals
- Executive review of top 10 deals

## Resources

- Forecast submission templates
- Forecast call agendas
- Accuracy tracking dashboards
- Deal review checklists

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Definitions:** Document commit vs. best case criteria
2. **Accountability:** Track and publish rep forecast accuracy
3. **Consistency:** Use same process every week/month
4. **Transparency:** Make forecast assumptions visible
5. **Discipline:** Don't allow category changes without justification
6. **Learning:** Review misses to improve future accuracy

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Sandbagging:** Reps under-forecast to beat expectations
2. **Hockey Sticks:** Over-optimistic late-quarter projections
3. **Category Creep:** Moving deals between categories without reason
4. **No Consequences:** Not holding reps accountable for accuracy
5. **Stale Data:** Forecasts based on outdated CRM information
