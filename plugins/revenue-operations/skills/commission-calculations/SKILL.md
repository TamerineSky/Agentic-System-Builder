# Commission Calculations

Comprehensive framework for sales compensation design including commission structures, quota allocation, accelerators, splits, and calculation methodologies.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing sales compensation plans for new fiscal year
- Calculating monthly/quarterly commission payments
- Resolving commission disputes and questions
- Modeling compensation plan scenarios
- Allocating quotas across sales team
- Designing accelerators and SPIFFs

## Commission Structure Models

### 1. Straight Commission (% of Revenue)

```
Commission = Revenue × Commission Rate

Example:
Revenue: $500K
Rate: 10%
Commission: $50K

Pros: Simple, easy to understand
Cons: No base salary security, highly variable
Use: Transactional sales, high-volume environments
```

### 2. Base Salary + Commission

```
Total Comp = Base Salary + (Revenue × Commission Rate)

Example:
Base: $80K
Revenue: $1.2M
Rate: 5%
Variable: $60K
Total OTE: $140K

Pros: Income stability + upside
Cons: More complex administration
Use: Most common in B2B sales
```

### 3. Tiered Commission (Accelerators)

```
Tier 1 (0-80% of quota): 8% commission rate
Tier 2 (80-100% of quota): 10% commission rate
Tier 3 (100%+ of quota): 12% commission rate

Example:
Quota: $2M, Actual: $2.4M

Tier 1: $1.6M × 8% = $128K
Tier 2: $400K × 10% = $40K
Tier 3: $400K × 12% = $48K
Total: $216K

Purpose: Incentivize exceeding quota
```

### 4. Quota Attainment Model

```
Commission = Base Commission × (Actual / Quota)

If Actual ≥ Quota:
   Apply accelerator multiplier

Example:
Base Commission (at 100%): $120K
Quota: $2M
Actual: $2.2M
Attainment: 110%

Commission = $120K × 1.10 × 1.15 (accelerator) = $152K
```

## Quota Allocation Methodology

**Top-Down Approach:**
```
1. Company Revenue Target: $100M
2. Less: Existing Customer Expansion: $30M
3. New Business Required: $70M
4. Sales Team: 50 reps
5. Average Quota: $70M / 50 = $1.4M per rep
```

**Adjustments for Fairness:**
- Territory quality (mature vs. greenfield)
- Rep experience (ramped vs. new hire)
- Segment (enterprise vs. SMB)
- Historical performance baseline

**Example Allocation:**
```
Enterprise Reps (10): $2.0M quota each ($20M total)
Mid-Market Reps (25): $1.4M quota each ($35M total)
SMB Reps (15): $1.0M quota each ($15M total)
Total: $70M new business
```

## Commission Calculation Examples

### New Business Commission

```
Deal Size: $100K ARR
Commission Rate: 10%
Commission: $10K (paid at booking)

Or amortized over 12 months:
Monthly: $833.33
```

### Renewal/Expansion Commission

```
Existing Customer: $500K ARR
Expansion: +$150K ARR (30% growth)
Renewal Commission: $500K × 2% = $10K
Expansion Commission: $150K × 5% = $7.5K
Total: $17.5K
```

### Split Commissions

```
Deal: $200K, 10% commission rate = $20K total

Splits:
- Account Executive (closer): 60% = $12K
- Solutions Engineer: 20% = $4K
- SDR (sourced lead): 20% = $4K
```

## Resources

- Commission plan templates
- Quota allocation spreadsheets
- Commission calculator tools
- Comp plan modeling scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Simplicity:** Keep plans understandable (1-page summary)
2. **Alignment:** Tie comp to company goals (ARR growth, net retention)
3. **Fairness:** Adjust quotas for territory differences
4. **Frequency:** Pay frequently (monthly or quarterly)
5. **Caps:** Consider accelerators but avoid unlimited upside
6. **Transparency:** Document all calculation rules clearly
7. **Testing:** Model plans with historical data before rollout

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-Complexity:** Plans with too many variables
2. **Misalignment:** Rewarding wrong behaviors (logo count vs. ARR)
3. **Unfair Quotas:** Not adjusting for territory quality
4. **Delayed Payment:** Paying commissions 90+ days after close
5. **Frequent Changes:** Changing plans mid-year
6. **Disputes:** Unclear rules leading to disagreements
7. **Gaming:** Loopholes allowing manipulation
