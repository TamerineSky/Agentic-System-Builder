## Example Interactions

**Example 1: Pipeline Hygiene Automation**

```
User: "Can you automate our pipeline cleanup process?"

Response:
I'll design an automated pipeline hygiene system for your CRM.

**Current Manual Process (Understanding):**
Assuming you currently manually:
- Review stale opportunities
- Flag old deals for follow-up
- Close lost opportunities with no activity
- Update stage based on inactivity

**Automated Pipeline Hygiene Solution:**

**1. STALE OPPORTUNITY DETECTION**

**Workflow: Flag Stale Deals**
- Trigger: Daily scheduled automation
- Criteria:
  - Opportunity Stage = "Qualification" AND Last Activity > 30 days
  - OR Stage = "Proposal" AND Last Activity > 20 days
  - OR Stage = "Negotiation" AND Last Activity > 15 days
  - AND Close Date < Today + 90 days
- Actions:
  - Set field "Pipeline_Health_Status" = "Stale - Needs Attention"
  - Create task for opportunity owner: "Review Stale Deal - [Opp Name]"
  - Send email alert to rep + manager
  - Add to "Stale Opportunities" report

**2. AUTO-CLOSE AGED OPPORTUNITIES**

**Workflow: Close Lost Inactive Deals**
- Trigger: Weekly scheduled automation
- Criteria:
  - Last Activity > 90 days
  - Stage != "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost"
  - No activities in last 90 days
  - Close Date < Today - 30 days
- Actions:
  - Update Stage = "Closed Lost"
  - Loss Reason = "No Activity - Auto Closed"
  - Send notification to rep (FYI, can reopen if needed)
  - Log note: "Auto-closed due to inactivity per hygiene policy"

**3. CLOSE DATE REALIGNMENT**

**Workflow: Adjust Unrealistic Close Dates**
- Trigger: Daily scheduled automation
- Criteria:
  - Close Date < Today
  - Stage != "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost"
- Actions:
  - Move Close Date to end of next month
  - Set field "Close_Date_Slipped" = TRUE
  - Create task: "Update Close Date - Deal Slipped"
  - Add to "Slipped Deals" report for manager review

**4. STAGE PROGRESSION VALIDATION**

**Workflow: Enforce Stage Entry Criteria**
- Trigger: Before record save (when stage changes)
- Criteria: Stage advancing (e.g., Qualification → Proposal)
- Validation Rules:
  - Qualification → Proposal requires:
    - Budget confirmed (picklist != blank)
    - Decision maker identified (checkbox = true)
    - Next steps defined (field != blank)
  - Proposal → Negotiation requires:
    - Proposal sent date populated
    - Economic buyer meeting completed
    - Evaluation criteria documented
- Actions:
  - Block stage advancement if criteria not met
  - Display error message with requirements
  - Create task with missing requirements

**5. ACTIVITY GAP DETECTION**

**Workflow: Flag Engagement Gaps**
- Trigger: Daily scheduled automation
- Criteria:
  - Days since last activity > threshold by stage:
    - Early stages (1-2): >14 days
    - Mid stages (3-4): >7 days
    - Late stages (5-6): >3 days
  - Stage != "Closed Won/Lost"
- Actions:
  - Set field "Engagement_Status" = "At Risk - Low Activity"
  - Send Slack/email alert to rep
  - Escalate to manager if gap > 21 days
  - Add to "Low Engagement Deals" dashboard

**6. DUPLICATE OPPORTUNITY PREVENTION**

**Workflow: Detect Potential Duplicates**
- Trigger: Before opportunity creation
- Logic:
  - Check for existing opportunities with same:
    - Account Name
    - Close Date within 30 days
    - Similar Opportunity Name (fuzzy match)
- Actions:
  - Display warning: "Potential duplicate detected"
  - Show existing opportunity details
  - Require confirmation to proceed

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Detection & Alerting (Week 1)**
- Implement workflows #1 and #5 (stale detection, activity gaps)
- Create supporting reports and dashboards
- Configure email/Slack notifications
- Test with sales ops team

**Phase 2: Auto-Remediation (Week 2)**
- Implement workflows #2 and #3 (auto-close, date adjustment)
- Start in "report only" mode for 1 week
- Review flagged records for accuracy
- Enable auto-actions after validation

**Phase 3: Validation & Prevention (Week 3)**
- Implement workflow #4 (stage validation)
- Train sales team on new requirements
- Document stage entry criteria
- Implement workflow #6 (duplicate prevention)

**Phase 4: Monitoring & Refinement (Week 4+)**
- Review automation execution logs
- Gather sales team feedback
- Adjust thresholds and criteria
- Measure impact metrics

**Success Metrics:**

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Manual pipeline review time: 10 hrs/week → 2 hrs/week (80% reduction)
- Stale opportunities: Reduced by 65% within 30 days
- Pipeline accuracy: Improved by 40%

**Data Quality:**

**What's Changing:**
- Automatic flags for stale opportunities (you'll get alerts)
- Auto-close of deals inactive >90 days (you can reopen if needed)
- Automatic close date adjustment for overdue deals
- Stage advancement requires key criteria (budget, decision maker, etc.)

**Why This Helps You:**
- Less manual pipeline cleanup
- Focus energy on winnable deals
- More accurate forecasts
- Clear guidance on stage progression

**Your Action:**
- Review alerts promptly (2-3 min/day)
- Update deal info to avoid auto-closure
- Ensure stage criteria met before advancing

**Automation Implementation:**

**Platform: Salesforce + Email**

**Step 1: Create Data Views**
```sql
-- Example SOQL Queries for Data Extraction

/* Daily Pipeline Snapshot */
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, StageName, Probability, CloseDate,
       OwnerId, Owner.Name, LastActivityDate, LastModifiedDate
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = FALSE
  AND CloseDate = THIS_FISCAL_QUARTER
ORDER BY Amount DESC

/* New Opportunities (Last 24h) */
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, Owner.Name, CreatedDate
FROM Opportunity
WHERE CreatedDate = YESTERDAY

/* Won Deals (Last 24h) */
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, Owner.Name, CloseDate
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsWon = TRUE
  AND CloseDate = YESTERDAY

/* At-Risk Deals */
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, StageName, LastActivityDate, CloseDate
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = FALSE
  AND LastActivityDate < LAST_N_DAYS:7
  AND Amount > 500000
```

**Step 2: Build Report Templates**
- Create Salesforce Report Types for each view
- Format with conditional formatting (red/yellow/green)
- Add charts and visualizations
- Enable export to PDF/CSV

**Step 3: Schedule Automation**

**Option A: Native Salesforce Scheduled Reports**
- Setup → Reports → Schedule Future Runs
- Configure recipients by role
- Set daily schedule (6:00 AM, 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM)
- Enable "Only send if results" option

**Option B: Custom Automation (More Flexible)**
- Apex scheduled job to run daily
- Query data, format HTML email
- Personalize content by recipient
- Send via Messaging.SingleEmailMessage

**Sample Apex Code Structure:**
```apex
global class DailyPipelineDigest implements Schedulable {
    global void execute(SchedulableContext sc) {
        // Query pipeline data
        List<Opportunity> pipeline = [SELECT ...];

        // Calculate metrics
        Decimal totalPipeline = 0;
        Decimal weightedForecast = 0;
        // ... calculations ...

        // Generate HTML email
        String emailBody = generateExecutiveDigest(metrics);

        // Send to recipients
        Messaging.SingleEmailMessage email = new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage();
        email.setToAddresses(new String[]{'vp-sales@company.com'});
        email.setSubject('Daily Pipeline Snapshot - ' + Date.today().format());
        email.setHtmlBody(emailBody);
        Messaging.sendEmail(new Messaging.SingleEmailMessage[]{email});

        // Generate manager-specific emails
        generateManagerDigests();

        // Generate rep-specific emails
        generateRepScorecards();
    }
}
```

**Schedule Job:**
```apex
// Schedule for 6:00 AM daily
DailyPipelineDigest digest = new DailyPipelineDigest();
String cronExp = '0 0 6 * * ?'; // 6 AM daily
System.schedule('Daily Pipeline Digest - Reps', cronExp, digest);
```

**Step 4: Dashboard Creation**

Create Salesforce Dashboards:
- **Executive Pipeline Dashboard** (refreshes hourly)
- **Manager Team Dashboard** (filtered by manager)
- **Rep Personal Dashboard** (filtered by rep)

Include components:
- Total pipeline gauge
- Pipeline by stage (funnel chart)
- Top deals table
- Activity trending (line chart)
- Win/loss analysis
- At-risk deal alerts

**Step 5: Mobile Optimization**

Ensure emails are mobile-friendly:
- Responsive HTML design
- Large tap targets for links
- Compressed images
- Key metrics at top
- Expandable sections for details

**Success Metrics:**

**Engagement:**
- Email open rate: Target >80%

**Example 3: Lead Routing Automation**

```
User: "Automate our inbound lead assignment process."

Response:
I'll design an intelligent automated lead routing system.

**AUTOMATED LEAD ROUTING SYSTEM**

**Current State Assessment:**
Assuming you currently manually assign leads, causing:
- Delays in lead response (avg 4-8 hours)
- Uneven distribution
- Territory misalignment
- Missed routing rules

**Automated Solution Design:**

**ROUTING LOGIC HIERARCHY:**

**1. Territory-Based Assignment (Primary)**

```
IF Lead.Country = "United States" THEN
    IF Lead.State IN ("CA", "OR", "WA", "NV", "AZ") THEN
        Region = "West"
    ELSE IF Lead.State IN ("NY", "NJ", "CT", "MA", "PA") THEN
        Region = "Northeast"
    ELSE IF Lead.State IN ("TX", "OK", "LA", "AR") THEN
        Region = "Central"
    // ... continue for all regions ...
ELSE IF Lead.Country IN ("UK", "FR", "DE", "ES", "IT") THEN
    Region = "EMEA"
ELSE IF Lead.Country IN ("AU", "NZ", "SG", "JP") THEN
    Region = "APAC"
```

**2. Account-Based Assignment (Override)**

```
// Check if lead belongs to existing account
Existing_Account = LOOKUP(Account, "Website Domain" = Lead.Email_Domain)

IF Existing_Account EXISTS THEN
    IF Existing_Account.Owner.IsActive = TRUE THEN
        Assign Lead to Existing_Account.Owner
        Lead_Type = "Existing Customer - Expansion"
        Priority = "High"
    ELSE
        // Account owner inactive, use territory logic
        Use Territory Assignment
    END IF
ELSE
    // New account, use territory logic
    Use Territory Assignment
END IF
```

**3. Company Size-Based Segmentation**

```
IF Lead.Number_of_Employees >= 5000 THEN
    Segment = "Enterprise"
    Assign to Enterprise_Team_Queue
ELSE IF Lead.Number_of_Employees >= 500 THEN
    Segment = "Mid-Market"
    Assign to Mid_Market_Team_Queue
ELSE IF Lead.Number_of_Employees >= 50 THEN
    Segment = "SMB"
    Assign to SMB_Team_Queue
ELSE
    Segment = "Small"
    Assign to SMB_Team_Queue
END IF
```

**4. Round-Robin Within Team**

```
// Get eligible reps in assigned territory/segment
Eligible_Reps = GET_ACTIVE_REPS(Region, Segment)

// Filter by capacity (current lead count)
Available_Reps = Eligible_Reps WHERE Lead_Count < Max_Capacity

// Sort by last assignment timestamp (least recently assigned first)
Sorted_Reps = SORT(Available_Reps BY Last_Assignment_Time ASC)

// Assign to first rep in sorted list
Assigned_Rep = Sorted_Reps[0]

// Update rep's last assignment time
UPDATE Assigned_Rep.Last_Assignment_Time = NOW()
```

**5. Overflow and Vacation Handling**

```
IF Assigned_Rep.Out_of_Office = TRUE THEN
    // Check for backup assignment
    IF Assigned_Rep.Backup_Rep != NULL THEN
        Assign to Assigned_Rep.Backup_Rep
    ELSE
        // Use next available rep in round-robin
        Assign to Sorted_Reps[1]
    END IF
END IF

IF ALL Reps at capacity THEN
    // Overflow queue
    Assign to Sales_Management_Queue
    Send alert to Sales_Ops
END IF
```

**IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Salesforce: Lead Assignment Rules**

```xml
<LeadAssignmentRule>
    <ruleEntry>
        <assignedTo>Queue: Enterprise West</assignedTo>
        <criteriaItems>
            <field>Lead.Country</field>
            <operation>equals</operation>
            <value>United States</value>
        </criteriaItems>
        <criteriaItems>
            <field>Lead.State</field>
            <operation>equals</operation>
            <value>CA,OR,WA,NV,AZ</value>
        </criteriaItems>
        <criteriaItems>
            <field>Lead.NumberOfEmployees</field>
            <operation>greaterThan</operation>
            <value>5000</value>
        </criteriaItems>
    </ruleEntry>
    <!-- Additional rules... -->
</LeadAssignmentRule>
```

**Salesforce Flow: Round-Robin Logic**

```
Start (Lead is created or updated)
    ↓
Decision: Existing Account?
    Yes → Assign to Account Owner
    No → Continue
    ↓
Decision: Territory + Segment
    Enterprise + West → Get Enterprise West Reps
    Enterprise + East → Get Enterprise East Reps
    Mid-Market + West → Get MM West Reps
    // ... etc ...
    ↓
Get Active Reps in Queue
Filter by Capacity (<20 leads)
Sort by Last Assignment Time ASC
    ↓
Decision: Any Available Reps?
    Yes → Assign to Sorted_Reps[0]
          Update Last Assignment Time
          Send notification to rep
    No → Assign to Manager Queue
         Send alert to Ops
    ↓
End
```
