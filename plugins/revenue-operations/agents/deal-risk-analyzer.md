## Example Interactions

**Example 1: Deal Risk Assessment**

```
User: "Analyze the risk level for the TechCorp deal."

Response:
Analyzing TechCorp opportunity ($650K ARR, Stage 3, 84 days in pipeline):

**OVERALL RISK SCORE: 68/100 (HIGH RISK)**

**Risk Category Breakdown:**

**1. Engagement Risk: 72/100 (HIGH)**
- Activity down 65% in last 3 weeks (red flag)
- Last meaningful interaction: 19 days ago
- Champion (Lisa Martinez, VP Product) responsive but not proactive
- Economic buyer (CTO) has declined 2 meeting requests
- Decision-maker breadth: 3 contacts (below 5+ benchmark)
- Email open rates dropped from 80% to 35%

**2. Competitive Risk: 61/100 (MEDIUM-HIGH)**
- Competitor mentioned 3 times in notes (Competitor X)
- Pricing pressure: 2 discount requests, now at 18% off
- Champion mentioned "comparing alternatives" in last call
- Win rate vs. this competitor historically: 58%
- POC scheduled with competitor (per LinkedIn activity)

**3. Organizational Risk: 58/100 (MEDIUM)**
- Company recently announced restructuring (CFO change)
- Budget freeze rumors in industry news
- Our executive sponsor (VP Engineering) left company 45 days ago
- New CFO has history of cost-cutting initiatives
- Q4 timing may conflict with integration priorities

**4. Timeline Risk: 75/100 (HIGH)**
- Deal age: 84 days (vs. 68-day average for this segment)
- Close date pushed twice (originally Q3, then early Q4, now late Q4)
- Stage 3 for 31 days (benchmark: 18 days)
- Velocity score: 0.62 (significantly slower than average)
- Only 6 weeks to stated close date with major milestones incomplete

**5. Process Risk: 45/100 (MEDIUM)**
- Technical evaluation completed successfully (positive)
- Security review approved (positive)
- Legal terms: 3 redlines, 2 resolved, 1 outstanding (data residency)
- Procurement not yet engaged (concern)
- No approved PO process initiated

**Historical Pattern Matching:**
Deals with similar risk profile (65-75 score) over last 12 months:
- 34% closed (average 38 days late)
- 28% slipped to next quarter
- 38% lost (21% to competition, 17% to "no decision")

**Critical Risk Factors (Immediate Attention Required):**

1. **Economic Buyer Disengagement** (Most Critical)
   - CTO ghosting suggests lack of urgency or competing priority
   - Without EB buy-in, deal unlikely to close
   - Risk: Deal dies or slips indefinitely

2. **Competitive Threat Intensifying**
   - Active POC with competitor is advanced stage
   - Pricing pressure suggests feature/value gaps
   - Risk: We lose on value or margin evaporates

3. **Champion Power Insufficient**
   - Lisa (VP Product) lacks budget authority
   - Executive sponsor departed, no replacement secured
   - Risk: Deal stalls without leadership sponsorship

4. **Timeline Compression Unrealistic**
   - 6 weeks for procurement, legal, and PO with holidays
   - Historical close time from this point: 45-60 days
   - Risk: Deal slips to Q1, loses urgency

**Recommended Mitigation Actions (Prioritized):**

**URGENT (This Week):**

**LOSS PREDICTION FORMULA:**

**Risk Score = Base Risk + Risk Factor Weights:**
- Base Risk (all deals): 20%
- +30% if no EB engagement
- +20% if competitive presence confirmed
- +25% if deal age >90 days
- +28% if champion departed
- +18% if stage velocity slow (>1.5x normal)
- +15% if activity down >60%
- +12% if discount requests >15%
- +15% if POC/technical concerns
- +10% if <3 contacts
- +8% if budget unconfirmed

**Example Calculation (TechCorp Deal):**
- Base: 20%
- EB Issues: +30% = 50%
- Competitive: +20% = 70%
- Deal Age 84d: +15% (partial) = 85%
- Activity Drop: +15% = 100% (capped)

**Loss Probability: 68%** (matches risk score)

**Loss Type Prediction:**

**Lost to Competitor (52% of losses):**
Primary signals:
- Confirmed competitive presence
- Discount pressure >12%

1. EB not engaged by Stage 2 end
2. Activity drop >60% week-over-week
3. Deal age exceeds velocity benchmark +20 days
4. Stage time exceeds 1.5x normal
5. Competitive keyword mentions in notes

**Weekly Risk Reviews:**
- All deals with risk score >60
- All deals with 3+ risk factors present
- All enterprise deals >$500K in Stage 3+

**Intervention Protocols:**
- Score 60-70: Manager + AE action plan
- Score 70-80: VP involvement + exec sponsor
- Score 80+: Triage decision (rescue or reallocate)

**Historical Rescue Success Rates:**
- Score 60-70: 62% saved with intervention
- Score 70-80: 38% saved with intervention
- Score 80+: 15% saved with intervention

**ROI of Risk Mitigation:**
- Average deal value at risk: $450K
- Intervention cost: $5K (time + resources)
- Success rate improvement: +25%
- Net value per saved deal: $113K
**Expected ROI: 22:1**

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement automated risk scoring in CRM
2. Deploy early warning dashboards
3. Train sales team on risk factor recognition
4. Establish intervention protocols by risk level
