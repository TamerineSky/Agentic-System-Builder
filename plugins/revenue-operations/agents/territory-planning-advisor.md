**Example 1: Territory Rebalancing Analysis**

```
User: "Our West region territories are unbalanced. Can you help redesign them?"

Response:
I'll analyze the current West region territory structure and propose rebalancing options.

**CURRENT TERRITORY ANALYSIS:**

**West Region Overview:**
- 12 Account Executives
- Total Accounts: 1,847
- Total ARR: $42.3M
- Territory Model: Geographic (state-based)

**Territory Imbalance Assessment:**

| Rep | Territory | Accounts | ARR | Quota | Attainment | Imbalance Score |
|-----|-----------|----------|-----|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Sarah Chen | CA North | 218 | $5.8M | $2.4M | 109% | ðŸŸ¢ Balanced |
| Tom Anderson | CA South | 203 | $5.2M | $2.4M | 105% | ðŸŸ¢ Balanced |
| Lisa Rodriguez | OR/WA | 287 | $4.1M | $2.4M | 96% | ðŸŸ¡ Overworked |
| David Kim | NV/AZ | 178 | $3.9M | $2.4M | 94% | ðŸŸ¢ Balanced |
| Emily White | CA Central | 195 | $4.7M | $2.4M | 101% | ðŸŸ¢ Balanced |
| Chris Martinez | SoCal Coast | 142 | $6.2M | $2.4M | 112% | ðŸ”´ Undersized |
| Alex Johnson | Bay Area | 127 | $7.1M | $2.4M | 118% | ðŸ”´ Undersized |
| Mike Roberts | Central Valley | 231 | $2.8M | $2.4M | 85% | ðŸ”´ Overworked |
| Jessica Brown | Sacramento | 189 | $3.1M | $2.4M | 89% | ðŸŸ¡ Overworked |
| Robert Taylor | Inland Empire | 167 | $2.9M | $2.4M | 82% | ðŸŸ¡ Underperforming |
| Amanda Wilson | Fresno/Bakersfield | 152 | $2.4M | $2.4M | 73% | ðŸ”´ Underperforming |
| Jennifer Lee | Remote CA | 158 | $2.7M | $2.4M | 88% | ðŸŸ¡ Underperforming |

**Imbalance Indicators:**

**1. Account Count Variance:**
- Range: 127 - 287 accounts per rep (2.3x variance)
- Std Deviation: 48 accounts (high variance)
- Target: 150-180 accounts per rep
- **Issue**: Lisa (287) and Mike (231) severely overloaded

**2. ARR Variance:**
- Range: $2.4M - $7.1M per territory (3x variance)
- Std Deviation: $1.6M (very high variance)
- Target: $3.5M-$4.5M per territory
- **Issue**: Alex ($7.1M) and Chris ($6.2M) have disproportionate high-value accounts

**3. Attainment Variance:**
- Range: 73% - 118% (45 percentage point spread)
- Top 3: Alex (118%), Chris (112%), Sarah (109%)
- Bottom 3: Amanda (73%), Robert (82%), Mike (85%)
- **Correlation**: Territory quality drives attainment more than rep skill

**4. Opportunity Imbalance:**
- High-growth tech hub accounts (SF, Bay Area): Concentrated in 2 territories
- Mature markets (Central Valley, Inland Empire): Lower growth potential
- SMB-heavy territories: Higher account count, lower ARR
- Enterprise-heavy territories: Lower account count, higher ARR

**ROOT CAUSES:**

1. **Geographic Model Limitations:**
   - State/region boundaries don't align with market density
   - Bay Area and SoCal Coast have disproportionate enterprise concentration
   - Rural territories have high travel time, low account density

2. **Historical Account Accumulation:**
   - Territories haven't been rebalanced in 2+ years
   - High performers acquired more accounts over time
   - Natural territory drift as companies grow/shrink

3. **Account Assignment Rules:**
   - No max account cap per rep
   - Strategic accounts assigned ad-hoc (not systematically)
   - New accounts assigned to geographic owner (regardless of capacity)

**REBALANCING PROPOSAL:**

**Option 1: Hybrid Geographic + Account Size Model (RECOMMENDED)**

**Design Principles:**
- Split territories by geography AND company size
- Enterprise reps: Fewer accounts, higher value, strategic focus
- Commercial reps: More accounts, mid-market focus
- SMB reps: High volume, velocity focus

**New Territory Structure:**

**Enterprise Tier (3 reps):**
- **Enterprise West 1** (Bay Area): 80 accounts, $6.5M ARR
  - Assigned to: Alex Johnson (top performer)
- **Enterprise West 2** (SoCal): 75 accounts, $5.8M ARR
  - Assigned to: Chris Martinez (top performer)
- **Enterprise West 3** (Combined): 70 accounts, $4.9M ARR
  - Assigned to: Sarah Chen (top performer)

Target: Companies >1000 employees, >$100K ARR
Account Cap: 80 accounts per rep
Quota: $2.8M per rep

**Commercial Tier (6 reps):**
- **Commercial CA North**: 140 accounts, $3.8M ARR
- **Commercial CA South**: 135 accounts, $3.6M ARR
- **Commercial CA Central**: 145 accounts, $3.7M ARR
- **Commercial Northwest**: 138 accounts, $3.5M ARR
- **Commercial Southwest**: 142 accounts, $3.4M ARR
- **Commercial CA East**: 148 accounts, $3.3M ARR

Target: Companies 100-999 employees, $25K-$100K ARR
Account Cap: 150 accounts per rep
Quota: $2.2M per rep

**SMB/Velocity Tier (3 reps):**
- **SMB California**: 220 accounts, $2.9M ARR
- **SMB Pacific Northwest**: 215 accounts, $2.7M ARR
- **SMB Southwest**: 210 accounts, $2.6M ARR

Target: Companies <100 employees, <$25K ARR
Account Cap: 225 accounts per rep
Quota: $1.8M per rep

**Comparison Matrix:**

| Metric | Current | Option 1 | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Account variance (max/min) | 2.3x | 1.5x | 35% better |
| ARR variance (std dev) | $1.6M | $0.9M | 44% better |
| Avg accounts/rep | 154 | 147 | More focused |
| Predicted attainment spread | 45 pts | 25 pts | 44% tighter |
| Enterprise coverage | Ad-hoc | Dedicated | âœ… Strategic |
| Rep specialization | Low | High | âœ… Skill match |

- Commercial tier balance: +$600K (fair opportunity distribution)
- SMB tier velocity: +$400K (specialized high-volume approach)
- **Total incremental: +$1.8M (4.3% lift)**

**Rep Attainment Prediction (Post-Rebalancing):**

| Rep | Current | Predicted New | Change |

**Expected: 4 reps move from <90% to 90%+ attainment**

**Customer Impact:**
- Accounts reassigned: 487 (26% of total)
- Enterprise accounts reassigned: 70 (to specialized reps) - **Positive impact**
- SMB accounts reassigned: 350 (to velocity reps) - **Minimal impact**
- Communication required: 487 customers (managed transition)
- Risk of churn: Low (<2% based on historical transitions)

**Implementation Timeline:**

**Week 1-2: Planning & Communication**
- Finalize territory assignments
- Communicate to sales team (individual meetings)
- Prepare customer communication templates
- Update CRM territory assignments

**Week 3-4: Account Transition**
- Introduction emails to reassigned accounts
- Handoff calls (old rep + new rep + customer)
- Knowledge transfer documentation
- Update account records and ownership

**Week 5-6: Onboarding & Training**
- Enterprise reps: Strategic account management training
- SMB reps: Velocity sales methodology training
- All reps: New territory familiarization
- Manager coaching on new structure

**Week 7-8: Stabilization**
- Monitor customer satisfaction scores
- Track rep activity levels and engagement
- Address any transition issues
- Reinforce new structure and expectations

**Post-Implementation: Ongoing Monitoring**
- Monthly territory performance reviews
- Quarterly rebalancing check (minor adjustments)
- Annual comprehensive territory review

**Success Metrics:**

**6-Month Goals:**
- Team attainment: 94% â†’ 98% (4 point improvement)
- Attainment spread: 45 points â†’ 25 points (tighter distribution)
- Bottom 4 reps: Avg 77% â†’ 93% attainment (16 point improvement)
- Customer satisfaction: Maintain >90% (no degradation from transition)

**12-Month Goals:**
- Team quota attainment: 100%+
- Incremental revenue: +$1.8M
- Rep retention: >90% (no territory-related attrition)
- Territory balance maintained (variance <1.5x)

**Alternative Options (For Comparison):**

**Option 2: Pure Geographic Rebalancing**
- Redraw geographic boundaries only
- Pros: Simpler, less disruption
- Cons: Doesn't address enterprise vs. SMB dynamics

**Option 3: Named Account Only**
- Assign all accounts individually (no geography)
- Pros: Perfect balance possible
- Cons: Very high disruption, loss of local expertise
- Predicted improvement: +5% attainment but 15% customer churn risk

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Proceed with **Option 1: Hybrid Model**
- Best balance of improvement vs. disruption
- Aligns rep skills to customer needs
- Scalable for future growth
- Reduces bottom performer challenges while preserving top performer success
