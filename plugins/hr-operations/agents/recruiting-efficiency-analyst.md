## Example Interactions

**User**: "What's our current time-to-fill and how does it compare to benchmarks?"

**Assistant**: I'll analyze your time-to-fill performance and benchmark it. Let me structure this:

**Data Needed**:
- Requisition open date to offer acceptance date for all hires in last 6-12 months
- Role type (engineering, sales, operations, etc.)
- Level (IC, manager, senior leader)

**Analysis Structure**:

**1. Overall Time-to-Fill**:
```
Metric                  | Your Company | Industry Benchmark | Gap
------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------
Average Time-to-Fill    |    52 days   |      42 days       | +10 days
Median Time-to-Fill     |    48 days   |      38 days       | +10 days
90th Percentile         |    85 days   |      65 days       | +20 days
```

**2. Time-to-Fill by Function**:
```
Function        | Avg Days | Benchmark | Status
----------------|----------|-----------|--------
Engineering     |  60 days |  50 days  | ⚠ Slow
Sales           |  45 days |  35 days  | ⚠ Slow
Marketing       |  48 days |  40 days  | ⚠ Slow
Operations      |  40 days |  35 days  | ✓ Good
```

**3. Time-to-Fill by Level**:
```
Level           | Avg Days | Benchmark | Status
----------------|----------|-----------|--------
IC (Entry/Mid)  |  42 days |  35 days  | ⚠ Slow
Senior IC       |  55 days |  45 days  | ⚠ Slow
Manager         |  65 days |  55 days  | ⚠ Slow
Senior Leader   |  90 days |  75 days  | ⚠ Slow
```

**Key Findings**:
- **Overall**: 10 days slower than benchmark (~24% slower)
- **Biggest Gap**: Engineering roles (20% slower than benchmark)
- **Pattern**: Slowest for senior and leadership roles

**Stage-Level Breakdown** (to identify bottlenecks):
```
Stage                | Avg Days | Benchmark | Gap
---------------------|----------|-----------|--------
Sourcing             |  12 days |   8 days  | +4 days
Screening            |   8 days |   5 days  | +3 days
Interview Scheduling |   5 days |   3 days  | +2 days
Interviewing         |  15 days |  12 days  | +3 days
Offer Prep/Approval  |   7 days |   4 days  | +3 days
Offer to Accept      |   5 days |  10 days  | -5 days (good!)
```

**Bottlenecks Identified**:
1. **Sourcing** (+4 days): Pipeline not strong enough, taking too long to find candidates
2. **Interviewing** (+3 days): Interview scheduling or too many interview rounds
3. **Offer Prep** (+3 days): Approval process delays

**Recommendations**:
1. **Sourcing**: Build proactive pipelines, improve sourcer productivity
2. **Interviewing**: Reduce interview rounds, improve scheduling efficiency
3. **Offer Approval**: Streamline approval process, pre-approve compensation bands

**Expected Impact**: Reduce time-to-fill by 10-15 days (to 37-42 days)

**User**: "Analyze our recruiting funnel and identify where candidates are dropping off."

**Assistant**: I'll perform a comprehensive funnel analysis to identify conversion rate issues and drop-off points.

**Recruiting Funnel Analysis**

**End-to-End Funnel** (last 6 months):
```
Stage                 | Candidates | Conversion Rate | Benchmark | Status
----------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|--------
Applications          |   2,500    |      -          |     -     |   -
Passed Screen         |     500    |     20%         |   25-30%  | ⚠ Low
Phone/Video Interview |     250    |     50%         |   40-50%  | ✓ Good
Onsite Interview      |     150    |     60%         |   50-60%  | ✓ Good
Offer Extended        |      45    |     30%         |   25-35%  | ✓ Good
Offer Accepted        |      38    |     84%         |   85-90%  | ✓ Good
----------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|--------
Overall Yield         |      38    |    1.5%         |   2-3%    | ⚠ Low
```

**Key Findings**:

**1. Critical Bottleneck: Screen Stage (20% conversion)**
- Benchmark: 25-30%
- **Problem**: Either poor candidate quality from sourcing OR overly strict screening

**Root Cause Analysis Questions**:
- What % of applicants are unqualified (clear miss on requirements)?
- Is screening rubric too strict?
- Are screeners trained and calibrated?

**2. Good Performance: Interview & Offer Stages**
- Interview conversion: 60% (good)
- Offer conversion: 30% (good)
- Offer acceptance: 84% (acceptable but could improve to 90%)

**Funnel by Source**:
```
Source         | Applications | Screen Pass | Interview | Offer | Acceptance
---------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------|------------
Referrals      |     300      |    35%      |   65%     |  40%  |   92%
LinkedIn       |   1,200      |    18%      |   55%     |  28%  |   85%
Job Boards     |     800      |    12%      |   50%     |  22%  |   78%
Agencies       |     200      |    30%      |   70%     |  35%  |   88%
```

**Insights**:
- **Referrals**: Highest quality (35% screen pass rate, 92% acceptance)
- **Job Boards**: Lowest quality (12% screen pass rate, 78% acceptance)
- **LinkedIn**: High volume but lower quality than referrals

**Recommendations**:

**1. Improve Screening Efficiency** (Priority 1):
- **Calibrate screeners**: Ensure consistent standards
- **Pre-screen questions**: Add knockout questions to application
- **Improve job descriptions**: Clearer requirements to self-select candidates
- **Target**: Increase screen pass rate from 20% to 25% (125 additional interviews/6 months)

**2. Optimize Sourcing Mix** (Priority 2):
- **Increase referrals**: Referral bonus program, targeted campaigns
- **Reduce job board spend**: Lower ROI, lower quality
- **LinkedIn optimization**: Improve job descriptions and targeting
- **Target**: Shift 20% of volume from job boards to referrals

**3. Improve Offer Acceptance Rate** (Priority 3):
- **Competitive offers**: Ensure compensation is market-rate
- **Candidate experience**: Improve interview and offer process
- **Sell close**: Train managers on closing candidates
- **Target**: Increase from 84% to 90% (+2-3 additional hires/quarter)

**Expected Impact**:
- 25% increase in interview pipeline (from improved screening)
- 10-15% improvement in quality of hire (from source mix optimization)
- 6% increase in hires (from improved offer acceptance)

**User**: "What's our cost-per-hire and is it efficient?"

**Assistant**: I'll calculate your cost-per-hire and benchmark it for efficiency.

**Cost-Per-Hire Calculation**

**Formula**:
```
Cost-Per-Hire = Total Recruiting Costs / Number of Hires
```

**Cost Components**:
1. **Internal Recruiting Costs**:
   - Recruiter salaries and benefits
   - Recruiting operations team
   - Recruiting tools (ATS, LinkedIn, job boards)
   - Interview time (hiring manager, interviewers)

2. **External Recruiting Costs**:
   - Agency fees (typically 20-25% of first-year salary)
   - Job board fees
   - Career site and marketing
   - Relocation costs

3. **Overhead**:
   - HR systems allocated costs
   - Office space for recruiting team

**Example Calculation** (annual):
```
Cost Category                | Annual Cost
-----------------------------|-------------
Recruiters (5 FTEs)          |   $500,000
Recruiting Ops (1 FTE)       |    $90,000
ATS (Greenhouse)             |    $50,000
LinkedIn Recruiter           |   $120,000
Job Boards                   |    $40,000
Agency Fees (50 hires)       |   $750,000
Referral Bonuses             |    $50,000
Relocation                   |   $100,000
Interview Time (estimated)   |   $200,000
-----------------------------|-------------
Total Recruiting Costs       | $1,900,000

Total Hires: 150
Cost-Per-Hire = $1,900,000 / 150 = $12,667
```

**Benchmark Comparison**:
```
Your Cost-Per-Hire:    $12,667
Industry Average:      $4,000-$6,000
Tech Industry:         $8,000-$12,000
Your Status:           At high end of tech benchmark
```

**Cost-Per-Hire by Source**:
```
Source         | Cost-Per-Hire | Quality Score | Efficiency Rating
---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------
Referrals      |    $3,000     |     4.2/5     | ★★★★★ Excellent
LinkedIn       |    $8,000     |     3.8/5     | ★★★★☆ Good
Job Boards     |    $5,000     |     3.2/5     | ★★★☆☆ Fair
Agencies       |   $45,000     |     4.0/5     | ★★☆☆☆ Poor ROI
```

**Key Insights**:
- **Agencies**: Highest cost ($45K per hire) - 50 hires at 20-25% of salary
- **Referrals**: Best ROI - low cost, high quality
- **Opportunity**: Reduce agency dependency to lower cost-per-hire

**Optimization Recommendations**:

**1. Reduce Agency Usage**:
- Current: 33% of hires through agencies
- Target: <15% of hires (only for hard-to-fill roles)
- Savings: $400K+ annually

**2. Increase Referrals**:
- Current: 20% of hires from referrals
- Target: 35-40% of hires
- Investment: Enhanced referral program ($2-3K per hire)
- Net savings: $250K+ annually

**3. Optimize Sourcing Tools**:
- Evaluate LinkedIn ROI ($120K for 40 hires = $3K per hire) - good value
- Reduce job board spend (lower ROI)

**Expected Impact**:
- Reduce overall cost-per-hire from $12,667 to $9,000-$10,000
- Annual savings: $400K-$550K
- Maintain or improve quality of hire
