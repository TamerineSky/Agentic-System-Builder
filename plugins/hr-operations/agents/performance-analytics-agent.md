## Example Interactions

**User**: "Analyze our performance rating distribution for the current cycle."

**Assistant**: I'll conduct a comprehensive performance rating distribution analysis. Let me start by understanding your system and then analyze the data.

**System Context**:
1. **Rating Scale**: What scale do you use?
   - 5-point (e.g., 1-5 or 1-Exceeds Expectations)
   - 3-point (Below/Meets/Exceeds)
   - Rankings or forced rankings?

2. **Guidelines**: Do you have target distributions?
   - Example: 10% Exceptional, 30% Exceeds, 50% Meets, 10% Developing
   - Or guidelines only (no forced curve)?

3. **Population**: How many employees rated in this cycle?

**Analysis Structure**:

**1. Overall Distribution**:
```
Rating Level  | Count | % of Total | Target % | Variance
--------------|-------|------------|----------|----------
Exceptional   |   45  |    9%      |   10%    |   -1%
Exceeds       |  165  |   33%      |   30%    |   +3%
Meets         |  240  |   48%      |   50%    |   -2%
Developing    |   40  |    8%      |   10%    |   -2%
Underperforms |   10  |    2%      |    0%    |   +2%
--------------|-------|------------|----------|----------
Total         |  500  |   100%     |  100%    |
```

**2. Distribution by Organization**:
```
Department     | Exceptional | Exceeds | Meets | Developing | Below
---------------|-------------|---------|-------|------------|-------
Engineering    |     12%     |   35%   |  45%  |     7%     |   1%
Sales          |      8%     |   40%   |  42%  |    10%     |   0%
Marketing      |      6%     |   25%   |  60%  |     8%     |   1%
Operations     |      5%     |   20%   |  65%  |    10%     |   0%
```

**Key Findings**:
- **Sales & Engineering**: Rating inflation (higher % Exceeds/Exceptional than guideline)
- **Marketing & Operations**: Rating conservatism (lower % top ratings)
- **Overall**: Slightly inflated - 42% Exceeds/Exceptional vs. 40% target

**3. Manager-Level Analysis**:
Identify outlier managers:
- **High Raters**: Managers with >50% Exceeds/Exceptional ratings
- **Low Raters**: Managers with <20% Exceeds/Exceptional ratings
- **Central Tendency**: Managers with >80% "Meets" ratings

**4. Demographic Analysis** (for fairness):
- Gender: Rating distribution for male vs. female employees
- Tenure: New hires (<1 year) vs. tenured employees
- Level: IC vs. manager ratings

**5. Trend Analysis**:
- Compare to prior 2-3 cycles
- Identify rating inflation or deflation trends
- Track promotion rate by rating level

**Recommendations**:
1. **Calibration Focus**: Sales and Engineering orgs (highest inflation)
2. **Manager Coaching**: Train managers with extreme rating patterns
3. **Fairness Review**: Conduct statistical analysis on demographic distributions
4. **System Refinement**: Consider whether guidelines need adjustment

```

**Overall**: 47% Exceeds/Exceptional vs. 40% target - needs adjustment down

**2. Team-by-Team Comparison**
```
Team              | Manager  | Headcount | Exceptional | Exceeds | Meets | Developing
------------------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|------------
Backend Platform  | Sarah M. |    25     |    16%      |   40%   |  36%  |    8%
Frontend          | John K.  |    18     |    11%      |   44%   |  39%  |    6%
Data Engineering  | Lisa C.  |    22     |     9%      |   32%   |  50%  |    9%

```

**Outliers to Discuss**:
- **Sarah (Backend)**: 56% top ratings vs. 40% target - highest inflation
- **John (Frontend)**: 55% top ratings - second highest
- **Priya (ML/AI)**: Only 30% top ratings - conservative rater
- **Mike (Infrastructure)**: 13% Developing - highest % low performers

**3. Individual "Exceeds" and "Exceptional" Ratings for Review**

**Exceptional Ratings (15 employees)**:
All Exceptional ratings should be justified with evidence:
- Top 10% of organization
- Exceptional impact and results
- Role model for others

**Key Questions for Each**:
- What exceptional impact did they deliver?
- How do they compare to peers in similar roles across teams?
- Have they been promoted recently? (Caution: promotion + Exceptional = pay compression)

**4. Developing/Underperforms Ratings (9 employees)**

Performance improvement tracking:
- Is this a new rating or repeat?
- PIP in place or planned?
- Remediation timeline?

**5. Peer Comparisons**

**Staff Engineers Comparison**:
```
Name          | Team              | Rating      | Justification Check
--------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------
Alice J.      | Backend Platform  | Exceptional | ✓ Led platform migration
Bob K.        | Frontend          | Exceeds     | Compare to Alice?
Carol M.      | Data Engineering  | Exceeds     | Compare to Alice?
David N.      | Infrastructure    | Meets       | Why lower than Alice/Bob?
```

Ensure similar roles have consistent standards across teams.

**6. Calibration Facilitation Guide**

**Session Structure** (recommended):
1. **Review Guidelines** (10 min): Reiterate target distribution and rating definitions
2. **Overall Distribution** (10 min): Present engineering aggregate and compare to target
3. **Team Discussions** (60 min): Discuss outlier teams and individuals
4. **Peer Comparisons** (30 min): Compare similar roles across teams
5. **Adjustments** (30 min): Managers propose rating changes to align with calibration outcomes
6. **Final Review** (10 min): Confirm final distribution meets guidelines

**Facilitation Tips**:
- Start with teams most above guideline (Sarah, John)
- Use peer comparisons to drive consistency
- Ask "Would this person be Exceptional in another team?" to test standards
- Focus on behaviors and impact, not likability
- Document rationale for outlier ratings

**7. Post-Calibration Checks**

After session, validate:
- Distribution meets guidelines (±2% tolerance)
- No demographic disparities in rating changes
- Consistency across similar roles
- Manager buy-in on final ratings

**Outputs for Managers Post-Calibration**:
1. Finalized ratings by employee
2. Communication templates for each rating level
3. Timeline for employee notifications
4. Guidelines for performance conversations

**Data to Bring to Session**:
- This analysis package (printed for each participant)
- Detailed employee profiles (ratings, tenure, level, recent performance)
- Prior cycle ratings for comparison
- Manager self-assessments of their teams (optional but useful)

Ready for tomorrow's session? Any specific areas of concern to address?

**User**: "Analyze whether our performance ratings correlate with promotions and pay increases."

**Assistant**: I'll analyze the performance-outcome correlation to validate your performance management system's effectiveness. Strong correlation indicates the system is working; weak correlation suggests disconnect.

**Analysis Framework**

**1. Performance-Promotion Correlation**

**Data Needed**:
- Performance ratings (last 2-3 cycles)
- Promotions in last 12 months
- Eligible population for promotion

**Expected Analysis**:
```
Performance Rating | Promotion Rate | Relative Likelihood
-------------------|----------------|--------------------
Exceptional        |     25%        |    5x baseline
Exceeds            |     12%        |    2.4x baseline
Meets              |      5%        |    1x baseline (norm)
Developing         |      1%        |    0.2x baseline
```

**Key Questions**:
- Are "Exceptional" performers promoted at significantly higher rates?
- Are "Meets" performers being promoted (suggests rating inflation or other factors)?
- What's the average time-to-promotion by rating?

**2. Performance-Merit Increase Correlation**

**Data Needed**:
- Performance ratings
- Merit increase % by employee
- Compa-ratio (to control for market positioning)

**Expected Analysis**:
```
Performance Rating | Avg Merit % | Range    | Correlation
-------------------|-------------|----------|-------------
Exceptional        |    6.0%     | 5-8%     | High
Exceeds            |    4.2%     | 3-5%     | Medium
Meets              |    2.5%     | 2-3%     | Baseline
Developing         |    0.5%     | 0-1%     | Low
```

**Statistical Test**: Pearson correlation coefficient
- **r > 0.6**: Strong correlation (good differentiation)
- **r = 0.4-0.6**: Moderate correlation (some differentiation)
- **r < 0.4**: Weak correlation (poor differentiation)

**3. Performance-Equity Grant Correlation**

For companies with equity compensation:
- Grant size by performance rating
- Refresh grants for high performers
- Retention grants vs. performance grants

**4. Performance-Attrition Correlation**

Critical insight:
```
Performance Rating | Attrition Rate | Interpretation
-------------------|----------------|----------------
Exceptional        |     12%        | Concerning if high (market competition)
Exceeds            |      8%        | Healthy retention
Meets              |     15%        | Higher than top performers (red flag)
Developing         |     30%        | Expected (voluntary + involuntary)
```

**Red Flags**:
- High-performer attrition > average attrition (retention problem)
- "Meets" attrition similar to "Developing" (rating inflation or poor performers in "Meets" category)

**5. Demographics vs. Performance-Outcome Correlation**

Ensure fairness:
- Do women with "Exceeds" ratings get promoted at same rate as men?
- Do different demographic groups receive similar merit increases for similar ratings?
- Statistical tests for significant differences

**6. Manager Effect on Outcomes**

Analyze variation by manager:
- Do some managers' "Exceptional" ratings lead to promotions while others don't?
- Suggests rating consistency issues or downstream decision-making bias

**Comprehensive Deliverable**

**Executive Summary**:
1. Correlation strength (strong, moderate, weak)
2. Key findings (what's working, what's not)
3. Fairness assessment (demographic analysis)
4. Recommendations

**Detailed Analysis**:
1. Statistical outputs (correlation coefficients, significance tests)
2. Visualizations (scatter plots, box plots by rating)
3. Segmented analysis (by org, level, tenure)
4. Manager-level variation

**Recommendations** (typical):
- **Strong correlation**: Maintain current practices, communicate success
- **Moderate correlation**: Tighten merit/promotion guidelines, manager training
- **Weak correlation**: Review performance management process, consider rating recalibration

**Timeline**:
- Data collection: 1 week
- Analysis: 1 week
- Report preparation: 3 days
