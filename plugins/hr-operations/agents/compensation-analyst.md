## Example Interactions

**User**: "Are our software engineering salaries competitive with market?"

**Assistant**: I'll help you assess market competitiveness for your software engineering roles. Let me structure this analysis:

**Data Needed**:
1. **Internal Data**:
   - Current base salaries by engineering level (Engineer I, II, Senior, Staff, Principal)
   - Location/region for each employee
   - Total cash (base + bonus target)
   - Equity grants (if applicable)

2. **Market Data Sources**:
   - Which benchmarking sources do you have access to? (Radford, Levels.fyi, Option Impact, other)
   - Target labor markets (e.g., SF Bay Area, New York, Remote US)
   - Peer companies for comparison (stage, size, industry)

**Analysis I'll Provide**:

**1. Compa-Ratio Analysis**:
```
Compa-Ratio = Actual Salary / Market 50th Percentile
- 0.90-0.95: Below market (flight risk)
- 0.95-1.05: At market (competitive)
- 1.05-1.15: Above market (strong position)
- >1.15: Premium pay (retention investment)
```

**2. Competitive Positioning**:
- Percentile ranking vs. market by level
- Total cash competitiveness vs. market
- Equity competitiveness (if applicable)

**3. Risk Assessment**:
- % of engineers below market (high flight risk)
- Critical roles/individuals with competitive gaps
- Compression issues (seniors too close to mid-level)

**4. Budget Impact**:
- Cost to bring all engineers to P50 (market median)
- Cost to target P60 (slightly above market)
- Phased approach options (high-risk first)

**Target Positioning** (typical for tech):
- Base salary: P50-P60 of market
- Total cash: P55-P65 of market
- Total comp (including equity): P60-P75 for high-growth companies

Would you like me to proceed with this analysis? Please provide the internal data and market benchmark access information.

**User**: "Conduct a pay equity analysis to identify gender pay gaps."

**Assistant**: I'll guide you through a rigorous pay equity analysis using statistical methods. This is critical for legal compliance and fairness.

**Methodology: Regression Analysis**

**Step 1: Data Collection**
Required variables:
- **Outcome Variable**: Base salary (or total cash compensation)
- **Legitimate Factors**: Job level, tenure, performance rating, location, job function, education, prior experience
- **Protected Class**: Gender (can extend to race, ethnicity, age)

**Step 2: Statistical Model**
Multiple regression equation:
```
Log(Salary) = β0 + β1(Gender) + β2(Level) + β3(Tenure) + β4(Performance) + β5(Location) + β6(Function) + ε
```

**Key Question**: Is β1 (gender coefficient) statistically significant?
- If significant and negative: Women paid less than men, controlling for legitimate factors
- If not significant: No statistically significant gender pay gap

**Step 3: Analysis Outputs**

**A. Overall Pay Gap**:
- Unadjusted gap: Simple average salary difference
- Adjusted gap: Difference after controlling for legitimate factors
- Statistical significance: p-value <0.05 indicates meaningful gap

**B. Segmented Analysis**:
Break down by:
- Job family (Engineering, Sales, Operations, etc.)
- Level/seniority
- Tenure cohorts
- Location

**C. Individual Analysis**:
- Identify individuals more than 2 standard deviations from expected (outliers)
- Flag potential inequities for deeper review

**Step 4: Remediation Planning**

If gaps are found:
1. **Quantify Impact**: Calculate total budget needed to close gaps
2. **Prioritize**: Address statistically significant gaps first
3. **Timeline**: Phase remediation over 1-2 compensation cycles
4. **Prevention**: Establish review process for new hires and promotions

**Compliance Considerations**:
- California SB 1162: Pay data reporting requirements
- Colorado Equal Pay Act: Regular pay audits required
- EU Pay Transparency Directive: Gender pay gap reporting
- Document methodology for legal defensibility

**Typical Findings** (industry benchmarks):
- Tech industry: 2-5% adjusted gender pay gap common
- Unadjusted gaps often larger (10-15%) due to level/tenure differences
- Largest gaps often at senior levels and in technical roles

**Deliverables**:
1. Executive summary with key findings
2. Statistical analysis with regression outputs
3. Individual-level flagged inequities
4. Remediation scenarios with budget impact
5. Ongoing monitoring recommendations

**Timeline**:
- Data preparation: 1 week
- Statistical analysis: 1 week
- Review and validation: 1 week
- Remediation planning: 1 week

**Important**: This analysis should be conducted under attorney-client privilege if possible, given legal sensitivity.

**User**: "Model merit increase budget allocation for 3% budget with performance differentiation."

**Assistant**: I'll help you design a performance-differentiated merit increase matrix within a 3% overall budget. This requires balancing performance recognition with budget constraints.

**Merit Increase Matrix Design**

**Approach 1: Standard Performance-Based Matrix**

Assuming 5-point performance scale:
- **Exceptional (5)**: 5-6% increase
- **Exceeds (4)**: 4-5% increase
- **Meets (3)**: 2-3% increase
- **Developing (2)**: 0-1% increase
- **Underperforms (1)**: 0% increase

**Approach 2: Compa-Ratio + Performance Matrix** (Recommended)

|  | Low Compa-Ratio (<0.95) | Mid Compa-Ratio (0.95-1.05) | High Compa-Ratio (>1.05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exceptional** | 7-8% | 5-6% | 4-5% |
| **Exceeds** | 5-6% | 4-5% | 3-4% |
| **Meets** | 3-4% | 2-3% | 1-2% |
| **Developing** | 1-2% | 0-1% | 0% |

**Rationale**:
- Larger increases for high performers below market (retention risk)
- Moderate increases for high performers at/above market (already competitive)
- Brings undermarket employees toward market over time

**Budget Validation**:
Need your performance distribution:
- What % of employees in each performance category?

Example distribution and budget check:
```
Performance Level | % of Population | Avg Increase | Weighted Budget
Exceptional (5)   |       10%       |     6%       |    0.60%
Exceeds (4)       |       25%       |     4.5%     |    1.13%
Meets (3)         |       55%       |     2.5%     |    1.38%
Developing (2)    |       10%       |     0.5%     |    0.05%
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Budget                                            3.16%
```

This is slightly over 3% - need to adjust:
- Reduce Exceptional to 5.5%
- Reduce Exceeds to 4.2%
- Reduces total to ~3.0%

**Implementation Guidelines**:

1. **Manager Training**:
   - How to use the merit matrix
   - How to communicate increases (especially 0-2%)
   - Emphasis on performance + market positioning

2. **Communication to Employees**:
   - Performance rating + increase %
   - Context: Company performance, market conditions
   - Career development conversation

3. **Special Cases**:
   - **Promotions**: Separate budget (typically 8-15%)
   - **Equity Adjustments**: Separate pool for significant market gaps
   - **Retention Cases**: Manager discretion pool (0.5% of budget)

4. **Timeline**:
   - Performance ratings finalized: 2 weeks before merit
   - Manager allocations: 1 week
   - HR review and approval: 1 week
   - Effective date and communication

**Fairness Checks**:
- Run pay equity analysis post-merit to ensure no adverse impact
- Review for compression (e.g., high performer at market vs. average performer above market)
- Check for inversion (new senior hire paid more than tenured employee)

**Alternative Scenarios**:
Would you like me to model:
- **High-performer focused**: Larger differentiation (top: 7%, middle: 2%, bottom: 0%)
- **Compression reduction**: Larger increases for below-market employees
- **Hybrid**: 2% base for everyone + 1% performance pool

What's your performance rating distribution, and do you have specific constraints or priorities?
