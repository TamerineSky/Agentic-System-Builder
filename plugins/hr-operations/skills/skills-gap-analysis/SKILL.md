# Skills Gap Analysis

Framework for assessing organizational skills inventory, identifying critical gaps, and developing strategic workforce capability plans.

## When to Use This Skill

- Assessing current organizational skills and capabilities
- Identifying skills gaps for strategic initiatives or growth
- Planning workforce development and training programs
- Supporting succession planning and talent pipeline development
- Informing hiring priorities and recruitment strategies
- Evaluating build vs. buy decisions for capabilities

## Core Concepts

### 1. Skills Taxonomy
Structured classification of skills:
```
Technical Skills: Role-specific expertise (e.g., Python, SQL, financial modeling)
Functional Skills: Domain knowledge (e.g., sales methodology, supply chain management)
Leadership Skills: People management and strategic thinking
Core Competencies: Company-wide expectations (e.g., collaboration, innovation)
```

### 2. Skills Gap
Difference between current state and required state:
```
Skills Gap = Required Skill Level - Current Skill Level

Gap can be:
- Individual (employee vs. role requirements)
- Team (team capabilities vs. objectives)
- Organizational (company vs. strategic needs)
```

### 3. Proficiency Levels
Standard skill rating scale:
```
1 - Awareness: Basic understanding
2 - Working Knowledge: Can perform with guidance
3 - Proficient: Independent contributor
4 - Advanced: Can mentor others
5 - Expert: Subject matter authority
```

## Quick Start

```python
def calculate_skills_gap(required_skills, current_skills):
    """
    Calculate gap between required and current skill levels
    """
    gaps = {}

    for skill, required_level in required_skills.items():
        current_level = current_skills.get(skill, 0)
        gap = required_level - current_level

        gaps[skill] = {
            'required': required_level,
            'current': current_level,
            'gap': gap,
            'priority': 'Critical' if gap >= 2 else 'Moderate' if gap == 1 else 'None'
        }

    return sorted(gaps.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['gap'], reverse=True)

# Example
required = {'Python': 4, 'SQL': 3, 'Machine Learning': 4, 'Data Visualization': 3}
current = {'Python': 3, 'SQL': 3, 'Machine Learning': 2, 'Data Visualization': 2}

gaps = calculate_skills_gap(required, current)
# Output: Machine Learning (gap=2, Critical), Python (gap=1, Moderate), ...
```

## Skills Gap Analysis Methodologies

### Pattern 1: Organizational Skills Inventory

```python
def skills_inventory(employee_data):
    """
    Aggregate organizational skills inventory

    employee_data: List of employees with their skill profiles
    """
    org_inventory = {}

    for employee in employee_data:
        for skill, level in employee['skills'].items():
            if skill not in org_inventory:
                org_inventory[skill] = {
                    'employee_count': 0,
                    'proficiency_distribution': {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0},
                    'avg_proficiency': 0,
                    'expert_count': 0
                }

            org_inventory[skill]['employee_count'] += 1
            org_inventory[skill]['proficiency_distribution'][level] += 1

            if level >= 4:
                org_inventory[skill]['expert_count'] += 1

    # Calculate averages
    for skill, data in org_inventory.items():
        total_proficiency = sum(
            level * count
            for level, count in data['proficiency_distribution'].items()
        )
        data['avg_proficiency'] = round(
            total_proficiency / data['employee_count'], 2
        )

    return org_inventory

# Identifies skills with few experts or low average proficiency
```

**Skills Inventory Output**:
```
{
  'Python': {
    'employee_count': 45,
    'proficiency_distribution': {1: 5, 2: 10, 3: 20, 4: 8, 5: 2},
    'avg_proficiency': 3.04,
    'expert_count': 10
  },
  'Machine Learning': {
    'employee_count': 12,
    'proficiency_distribution': {1: 2, 2: 5, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 0},
    'avg_proficiency': 2.33,
    'expert_count': 1  # âš  Single point of failure
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Strategic Skills Gap Analysis

```python
def strategic_gap_analysis(current_inventory, strategic_initiatives):
    """
    Identify skills gaps for strategic objectives

    strategic_initiatives: Future capabilities needed
    """
    gap_analysis = {}

    for initiative in strategic_initiatives:
        required_skills = initiative['required_skills']
        initiative_gaps = []

        for skill, required_level in required_skills.items():
            current_data = current_inventory.get(skill, {
                'employee_count': 0,
                'avg_proficiency': 0,
                'expert_count': 0
            })

            gap = {
                'skill': skill,
                'required_level': required_level,
                'current_avg': current_data['avg_proficiency'],
                'current_experts': current_data['expert_count'],
                'gap_severity': calculate_gap_severity(required_level, current_data)
            }

            initiative_gaps.append(gap)

        gap_analysis[initiative['name']] = sorted(
            initiative_gaps,
            key=lambda x: x['gap_severity'],
            reverse=True
        )

    return gap_analysis

def calculate_gap_severity(required_level, current_data):
    """
    Quantify severity of skills gap
    """
    avg_gap = required_level - current_data['avg_proficiency']
    has_experts = current_data['expert_count'] >= 2

    # Severity factors: size of gap, lack of experts
    severity = avg_gap * (1 if has_experts else 1.5)

    return round(severity, 2)

# Prioritizes skills development based on strategic needs
```

### Pattern 3: Individual Development Planning

```python
def individual_development_plan(employee_skills, role_requirements, career_path):
    """
    Create personalized skills development plan

    Considers current role needs and career aspirations
    """
    # Gap for current role
    current_role_gaps = []
    for skill, required in role_requirements.items():
        current = employee_skills.get(skill, 0)
        if current < required:
            current_role_gaps.append({
                'skill': skill,
                'current': current,
                'required': required,
                'gap': required - current,
                'priority': 'High'
            })

    # Gap for career path
    future_role_gaps = []
    for skill, required in career_path['required_skills'].items():
        current = employee_skills.get(skill, 0)
        if current < required:
            future_role_gaps.append({
                'skill': skill,
                'current': current,
                'required': required,
                'gap': required - current,
                'priority': 'Medium'
            })

    # Recommended learning path
    learning_plan = {
        'immediate_focus': current_role_gaps,
        'career_development': future_role_gaps,
        'estimated_timeline': estimate_development_timeline(
            current_role_gaps + future_role_gaps
        )
    }

    return learning_plan

def estimate_development_timeline(gaps):
    """
    Estimate time needed for skills development

    Rule of thumb: 3-6 months per proficiency level
    """
    total_gap = sum(gap['gap'] for gap in gaps)
    months = total_gap * 4  # Average 4 months per level

    return f"{months} months ({round(months/12, 1)} years)"
```

## Advanced Topics

### Skills-Based Hiring

Shift from role-based to skills-based recruitment:

```python
def skills_based_hiring(open_role_skills, candidate_skills):
    """
    Match candidates to roles based on skills fit

    More flexible than traditional role matching
    """
    skills_match = {}

    for skill, required_level in open_role_skills.items():
        candidate_level = candidate_skills.get(skill, 0)

        match_score = min(candidate_level / required_level, 1.0) * 100

        skills_match[skill] = {
            'required': required_level,
            'candidate': candidate_level,
            'match_score': round(match_score, 1),
            'status': 'Meets' if candidate_level >= required_level else 'Gap'
        }

    overall_match = sum(s['match_score'] for s in skills_match.values()) / len(skills_match)

    return {
        'skills_breakdown': skills_match,
        'overall_match': round(overall_match, 1),
        'recommendation': 'Strong Fit' if overall_match >= 80 else 'Partial Fit' if overall_match >= 60 else 'Poor Fit'
    }
```

### Build vs. Buy Analysis

Determine whether to develop internally or hire externally:

```python
def build_vs_buy_decision(skill_gap, internal_candidates, market_availability):
    """
    Analyze build (develop) vs. buy (hire) for skills gap

    Factors: Development time, cost, market availability, retention risk
    """
    # Build (Develop Internally)
    build_option = {
        'timeline_months': estimate_training_time(skill_gap),
        'cost': estimate_training_cost(internal_candidates, skill_gap),
        'risk': 'Medium' if internal_candidates else 'High',
        'retention': 'High (increases engagement)'
    }

    # Buy (Hire Externally)
    buy_option = {
        'timeline_months': estimate_hiring_time(market_availability),
        'cost': estimate_hiring_cost(skill_gap['market_salary']),
        'risk': 'Low' if market_availability == 'High' else 'High',
        'retention': 'Medium (new hire ramp and retention risk)'
    }

    # Recommendation
    if build_option['timeline_months'] < 6 and internal_candidates:
        recommendation = 'Build (Develop Internally)'
    elif market_availability == 'High' and buy_option['timeline_months'] < build_option['timeline_months']:
        recommendation = 'Buy (Hire Externally)'
    else:
        recommendation = 'Hybrid (Develop + Hire)'

    return {
        'build_option': build_option,
        'buy_option': buy_option,
        'recommendation': recommendation
    }
```

### Skills Decay & Upskilling

Account for skills depreciation over time:

```python
def skills_decay_forecast(current_skills, technology_half_life):
    """
    Forecast skills decay based on technology change

    technology_half_life: Years for skill to become 50% less valuable
    """
    import math

    decayed_skills = {}

    for skill, current_level in current_skills.items():
        half_life = technology_half_life.get(skill, 5)  # Default 5 years

        # Exponential decay model
        years_ahead = 2  # Forecast 2 years
        decay_factor = 0.5 ** (years_ahead / half_life)

        decayed_level = current_level * decay_factor

        decayed_skills[skill] = {
            'current_level': current_level,
            'forecasted_level_2yr': round(decayed_level, 1),
            'upskilling_needed': round(current_level - decayed_level, 1)
        }

    return decayed_skills

# Example: JavaScript frameworks (3-year half-life), Cloud (5-year), Agile (7-year)
```

- **Skills Taxonomies**: LinkedIn Skills, O*NET, Lightcast (formerly Emsi), Degreed
- **Assessment Tools**: SkillsAI, Degreed, EdCast, 360Learning
- **Learning Platforms**: Udemy for Business, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight
- **Skills-Based HR Systems**: Workday Skills Cloud, Eightfold.ai, Gloat
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Average skills half-life: 5 years (faster in tech: 2-3 years)
  - Development time: 3-6 months per proficiency level
  - Training budget: 1-3% of payroll typical

## Best Practices

1. **Current State Baseline**: Start with comprehensive skills inventory
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Link skills needs to business strategy and initiatives
3. **Proficiency Standards**: Use consistent 1-5 scale across organization
4. **Regular Assessment**: Annual or bi-annual skills assessment cycles
5. **Individual Development Plans**: Personalized plans for every employee
6. **Build-Buy Balance**: Mix of internal development and external hiring
7. **Manager Involvement**: Managers as skills coaches and development advocates
8. **Career Pathing**: Connect skills development to career progression
9. **Technology Currency**: Account for skills decay in fast-changing fields
10. **Measure Outcomes**: Track skills development impact on performance and retention

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Static Analysis**: One-time assessment without ongoing updates
2. **No Strategic Link**: Skills analysis disconnected from business needs
3. **Self-Assessment Only**: Overreliance on self-ratings (inflate proficiency)
4. **Generic Development**: One-size-fits-all training vs. personalized plans
5. **Build-Only Mentality**: Trying to develop all skills internally (too slow)
6. **Buy-Only Mentality**: Always hiring externally (misses internal talent)
7. **No Expert Identification**: Not tracking subject matter experts and single points of failure
8. **Skills Decay Ignored**: Not accounting for technology obsolescence
9. **No Measurement**: Not tracking skills development completion and impact
10. **Lack of Accountability**: Skills development without manager or employee ownership
