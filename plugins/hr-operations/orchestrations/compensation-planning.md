# Annual Compensation Planning Orchestration

## Overview
Comprehensive annual compensation planning process including market benchmarking, pay equity analysis, merit increase planning, promotion planning, and total rewards strategy aligned with budget and retention objectives.

## Objective
Develop fair, competitive, and fiscally responsible compensation plan that rewards performance, retains top talent, maintains internal equity, and operates within approved budget parameters.

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Planning Kickoff & Market Benchmarking

**Agent**: compensation-analyst
**Command**: /compensation-review --org "all" --roles "all"
**Activities**:
- Secure access to market benchmark data (Radford, Mercer, Payscale, Levels.fyi)
- Match internal roles to market job codes
- Extract market data (P25, P50, P75, P90) for all roles
- Adjust for geographic locations
- Calculate current compa-ratios (salary / midpoint)
- Identify competitive gaps and risks

**Output**:
- Market benchmarking report by role/level
- Compa-ratio distribution analysis
- Competitive risk assessment (employees below market)
- Geographic pay differential analysis

---

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Pay Equity Analysis

**Agent**: compensation-analyst
**Activities**:
- Conduct statistical regression analysis for pay equity
- Control for legitimate factors (level, tenure, performance, location)
- Analyze by protected class (gender, race, age)
- Identify statistically significant pay gaps
- Flag individual employees >2 standard deviations from expected
- Quantify remediation cost

**Skills**: compensation-benchmarking, diversity-inclusion-metrics
**Output**:
- Pay equity analysis report with statistical findings
- Individual-level equity adjustments needed
- Total remediation budget estimate
- Compliance assessment

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Performance Integration & Merit Matrix Design

**Agent**: performance-analytics-agent
**Command**: /performance-distribution --cycle "current" --org "all"
**Activities**:
- Finalize performance ratings (see Performance Review Cycle)
- Analyze performance distribution across organization
- Validate performance-compensation correlation from prior year

**Agent**: compensation-analyst
**Activities**:
- Design merit increase matrix (performance Ã— compa-ratio)
- Model merit budget scenarios (3%, 3.5%, 4% total budget)
- Balance performance differentiation with budget constraints
- Design promotion increase guidelines (8-15% by level)
- Plan equity compensation pool (RSUs, options)

**Merit Matrix Example (3% total budget)**:
```
                  Low Compa (<0.95) | Mid Compa (0.95-1.05) | High Compa (>1.05)
Exceptional       7%                 | 5.5%                  | 4%
Exceeds           5%                 | 4%                    | 3%
Meets             3.5%               | 2.5%                  | 1.5%
Developing        1%                 | 0.5%                  | 0%
```

**Scenario Comparison**:
```
                    | Conservative | Base | Aggressive
Total Merit Budget  | $1.2M (3%)   | $1.4M (3.5%) | $1.6M (4%)
Pay Equity          | $200K        | $200K | $200K
