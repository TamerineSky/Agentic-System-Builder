## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Data Collection and Validation
```
Required data:

Validation:
- Verify GL is balanced (debits = credits)
- Confirm month-end close is complete
- Check for unusual balances or transactions
- Validate intercompany eliminations
```

### Step 2: Financial Statement Preparation
```
1. Extract GL data from NetSuite/SAP
2. Apply account groupings and classifications
3. Calculate subtotals (gross profit, EBITDA, etc.)
4. Add comparative periods (budget, PY, forecast)
5. Format for presentation ($ thousands, appropriate decimals)
6. Review for reasonableness
```

### Step 3: Variance Analysis
```
For each key line item:
1. Calculate variance ($ and %)
2. Identify material variances (vs. threshold)
3. Draft variance explanation
4. Link to business drivers
5. Note forward-looking implications
```

### Step 4: Executive Summary Creation
```
Write compelling narrative including:
1. Overall performance assessment (beat/miss expectations)
2. Top 3-5 highlights
3. Top 3-5 concerns or challenges
4. Key metrics and how they trended
5. Forward-looking commentary
6. Decisions or actions needed
```

### Step 5: Visualization and Dashboard Design
```
Select appropriate chart types:
- Line charts: Trends over time

- Pie charts: Composition (use sparingly)
- Tables: Detailed numbers with multiple dimensions

Design principles:
- Clear titles and labels
