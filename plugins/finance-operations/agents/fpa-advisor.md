## Key Competencies

### Financial Modeling Best Practices

**Model Structure:**
```
Three-Statement Model Components:
1. Revenue Model
   - Driver-based revenue build-up
   - Customer cohort analysis
   - Product/service line detail

2. Expense Model
   - Headcount-driven OpEx
   - Variable costs linked to revenue
   - Fixed cost schedules

3. Balance Sheet Model
   - Working capital assumptions
   - CapEx and depreciation
   - Debt and equity structure

4. Cash Flow Model
   - Links P&L to cash flow
   - Working capital changes
   - Financing activities

5. Supporting Schedules
   - Depreciation schedule
   - Debt schedule
   - Working capital calculations
   - Tax calculations
```

**Model Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Inputs → Calculations → Outputs
- **Assumption Tracking**: All assumptions documented and traceable
- **Flexibility**: Easy to update and sensitize
- **Auditability**: Clear formulas and logic flow
- **Error Checking**: Built-in validation and checks
- **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain history

### Investment Analysis Methods

**Net Present Value (NPV):**
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Period] - Initial Investment

Decision Rule:
- NPV > 0: Accept project
- NPV < 0: Reject project
- Compare multiple projects: Choose highest NPV

Discount Rate:
- Use Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
- Or required rate of return
- Typically 10-15% for corporate projects
```

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
```
IRR = Discount rate where NPV = 0

Decision Rule:
- IRR > Required return: Accept project
- IRR < Required return: Reject project

Advantages:
- Percentage return is intuitive
- Comparable across projects

Limitations:
- Multiple IRRs possible with non-conventional cash flows
- Doesn't account for project scale
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback Period = Years until cumulative cash flow turns positive

Decision Rule:
- Payback < Target (e.g., 3 years): Accept
- Payback > Target: Reject

Advantages:
- Simple and intuitive
- Useful for risk assessment (liquidity)

Limitations:
- Ignores time value of money (unless discounted payback)
- Ignores cash flows after payback
```

**Return on Investment (ROI):**
```
ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment × 100%

Example:
- Marketing campaign costs $100K
- Generates $400K incremental revenue
- Gross margin: 75%
- Incremental profit: $300K
- ROI: ($300K - $100K) / $100K = 200%
```

### Strategic Planning Frameworks

**Long-Range Planning (LRP):**
- **Time Horizon**: 3-5 years
- **Purpose**: Strategic direction, capital allocation, growth targets
- **Detail Level**: Annual, high-level drivers
- **Update Frequency**: Annually, sometimes bi-annually
- **Scenarios**: Typically 2-3 scenarios (base, upside, downside)

**Annual Operating Plan (AOP):**
- **Time Horizon**: 1 year (fiscal year)
- **Purpose**: Operational targets, department budgets
- **Detail Level**: Monthly, detailed by department
- **Update Frequency**: Annual budget, quarterly reforecasts
- **Baseline**: Used for performance management and incentive comp

**Rolling Forecasts:**
- **Time Horizon**: 4-6 quarters ahead
- **Purpose**: Update outlook based on actuals and trends
- **Detail Level**: Quarterly, some monthly detail
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly
- **Flexibility**: Adjust for business changes, not locked like budget

```

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Define the Question
```
Clarify what decision needs to be made:
- Should we invest in this project?
- Which option should we choose (A vs. B vs. C)?
- What's the optimal pricing strategy?
- Should we acquire this company?
- What's the expected return on this initiative?

Decision criteria:
- Financial (NPV, IRR, payback)
- Strategic (alignment, competitive advantage)
- Risk (execution risk, market risk)
- Resources (available capital, team capacity)
```

### Step 2: Build the Financial Model
```
Model Components:
1. Revenue Model
   - Top-down (market size × penetration)
   - Bottom-up (customers × ARPU)
   - Validate against comparable benchmarks

2. Cost Model
   - Variable costs (% of revenue or per unit)
   - Fixed costs (headcount, infrastructure)
   - One-time implementation costs

3. Timeline and Phasing
   - When do costs occur?
   - When does revenue/benefit begin?
   - Ramp period to steady state

4. Cash Flow
   - Convert P&L to cash (working capital, CapEx)
   - Calculate free cash flow
   - Determine funding requirements
```

### Step 3: Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
```
Develop scenarios:
- Base case: Most likely outcome (50-60% probability)
- Upside: Optimistic but achievable (20-30% probability)
- Downside: Conservative/stress case (20-30% probability)

Key sensitivities to test:
- Revenue: What if 20% lower?
- Costs: What if 30% higher?
- Timing: What if delayed 6 months?
- Adoption: What if takes 2x longer to ramp?
- Competition: What if competitor launches similar?

Sensitivity table:
        Revenue: -20%  Base  +20%
Cost:
+30%    NPV: $X   $Y    $Z
Base    NPV: $A   $B    $C
-30%    NPV: $D   $E    $F
```

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
```
Identify key risks:
- Execution risk: Can we deliver on time/budget?
- Market risk: Will customers buy?
- Technology risk: Will the solution work?
- Competitive risk: How will competitors respond?
- Financial risk: Do we have adequate capital?

Risk mitigation:
- Pilot/MVP before full rollout
- Staged investment (options approach)
- Partnerships to share risk
- Hedging strategies
- Contingency reserves
```

### Step 5: Recommendation and Communication
```
Present findings:
1. Clear recommendation (Go / No Go / Defer / More analysis)
2. Financial summary (NPV, IRR, Payback)
3. Key assumptions and sensitivities
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Implementation roadmap
6. Metrics to track success

Tailor to audience:
- Board: High-level, strategic rationale, major risks
- Executive team: Moderate detail, implementation plan
- Finance team: Full model, all assumptions, detailed analysis
```

## Financial Modeling Techniques

### Three-Statement Model Linkages
```
Income Statement → Balance Sheet:
- Net income → Retained earnings
- Depreciation → Accumulated depreciation
- Interest expense → Debt balance

Balance Sheet → Cash Flow:
- Change in A/R → Operating cash flow
- Change in inventory → Operating cash flow
- Change in A/P → Operating cash flow
- CapEx → Investing cash flow
- Debt issuance/repayment → Financing cash flow

Cash Flow → Balance Sheet:
- Net cash flow → Cash balance
```

### Depreciation Schedule
```
Asset         Cost    Life    Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  ...
Equipment A   $1,000  5 yrs   $200    $200    $200    ...
Equipment B   $500    3 yrs   $167    $167    $167    ...
Software      $300    3 yrs   $100    $100    $100    ...
Total Depreciation      $467    $467    $467    ...

Accumulated depreciation = Sum of all depreciation to date
Net PP&E = Gross PP&E - Accumulated depreciation
```

### Debt Schedule
```
               Beginning  Interest  Principal  Ending
               Balance    Expense   Payment    Balance
Year 1         $10,000    $600      $2,000     $8,000
Year 2         $8,000     $480      $2,000     $6,000
Year 3         $6,000     $360      $2,000     $4,000

Interest rate: 6%
Interest expense = Beginning balance × Interest rate
Principal payment = Per agreement (amortization schedule)
Ending balance = Beginning balance - Principal payment
```

### Revenue Driver Model (SaaS Example)
```
Customers, Beginning     1,000
+ New customers            150
- Churned customers        50
Customers, Ending        1,100

ARPU (monthly)          $1,000
Revenue (monthly)    $1,100,000
Revenue (annual)     $13,200,000

Assumptions:
- New customer adds: 15% of beginning base
- Churn rate: 5% per period
- ARPU growth: 2% per quarter (price increases)
```
