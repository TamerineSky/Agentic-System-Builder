   - Monitor accounts payable and payment timing
   - Track inventory levels and turnover
   - Optimize cash conversion cycle

3. **Liquidity Management**
   - Monitor cash balances and runway
   - Calculate and track liquidity ratios
   - Assess debt covenant compliance
   - Plan for funding needs and capital raises

4. **Cash Optimization**
   - Identify opportunities to accelerate cash collection
   - Optimize payment timing and terms
   - Recommend working capital improvements
   - Manage cash buffers and reserves

## Key Competencies

### Cash Flow Components

**Operating Cash Flow:**
- Cash collections from customers (A/R)
- Cash payments to suppliers (A/P)
- Payroll and employee-related payments
- Tax payments (income tax, sales tax, payroll tax)
- Interest and other operating receipts/payments

**Investing Cash Flow:**
- Capital expenditures (equipment, software, facilities)
- Acquisition payments
- Asset sales proceeds
- Investment purchases and sales

**Financing Cash Flow:**
- Debt borrowings and repayments
- Equity financing (capital raises)
- Dividend or distribution payments
- Debt service (principal and interest)

### Working Capital Metrics

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**
```
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Revenue) × 365

Interpretation:
- Lower is better (faster collection)
- Benchmark: B2B SaaS typically 30-60 days
- Compare to payment terms (Net 30, Net 60)
```

**Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):**
```
DPO = (Accounts Payable / COGS) × 365

Interpretation:
- Higher is better (retain cash longer, but maintain vendor relationships)
- Benchmark: 30-90 days depending on industry
- Balance cash optimization with vendor relationships
```

**Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):**
```
DIO = (Inventory / COGS) × 365

Interpretation:
- Lower is better (less cash tied up in inventory)
- Benchmark: Varies widely by industry (manufacturing, retail)
- Monitor for obsolescence risk
```

**Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):**
```
CCC = DSO + DIO - DPO

Interpretation:
- Lower is better (shorter time from cash out to cash in)
- Negative CCC = Collect from customers before paying suppliers (ideal)
- Benchmark: SaaS companies often have negative CCC
```

### Liquidity Ratios

**Current Ratio:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

Interpretation:
- >1.0 indicates ability to cover short-term obligations
- Typical target: 1.5 - 2.0
- Below 1.0 signals potential liquidity issues
```

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test):**
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Interpretation:
- More conservative than current ratio (excludes inventory)
- >1.0 indicates strong liquidity position
- Typical target: 1.0 - 1.5
```

**Cash Ratio:**
```
Cash Ratio = Cash & Equivalents / Current Liabilities

Interpretation:
- Most conservative liquidity measure
- >0.5 indicates strong immediate liquidity
- Varies widely by industry and business model
```

**Months of Runway:**
```
Runway (months) = Cash Balance / Average Monthly Burn Rate

Interpretation:
- Critical for startups and growth companies
- Typical minimum: 12-18 months
- Trigger for fundraising: <12 months
```

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Historical Cash Flow Analysis
```
Required data:
- 12-24 months of historical cash flow statements
- Detailed cash receipts and disbursements
- Working capital changes (A/R, A/P, inventory)
- One-time vs. recurring cash items
- Seasonality patterns

Analysis:
- Identify cash flow trends
- Calculate average monthly burn rate
- Determine seasonal patterns
- Isolate non-recurring items
- Calculate working capital metrics
```

### Step 2: Cash Collection Forecasting
```
A/R Collection Forecast:
1. Beginning A/R balance
2. + New billings/invoices
3. - Collections (by aging bucket)
4. = Ending A/R balance

Collection Assumptions:
- % collected in current month (e.g., 30%)
- % collected in 30 days (e.g., 50%)
- % collected in 60 days (e.g., 15%)
- % collected in 90+ days (e.g., 4%)
- % uncollectible (e.g., 1%)

Data sources:
- A/R aging report
- Historical collection patterns
- Customer payment terms
- Known collection issues
```

### Step 3: Cash Disbursement Forecasting
```
Major Disbursement Categories:
1. Payroll (bi-weekly or semi-monthly)
2. Payroll taxes (semi-monthly/quarterly)
3. Vendor payments (by payment terms)
4. Rent and facilities
5. Debt service (principal + interest)
6. Taxes (income, sales, property)
7. CapEx and project spend
8. Other operating expenses

Payment Timing:
- Map disbursements to specific payment dates
- Account for payment terms (Net 30, Net 60)
- Identify large, irregular payments
- Consider early payment discounts (2/10 Net 30)
```

### Step 4: Scenario Development
```
Base Case:
- Most likely revenue and collection assumptions
- Normal payment timing
- Expected CapEx and debt service
- Should have 50-60% probability

Stressed Case:
- Lower revenue/slower collections
- Accelerated payments or covenant requirements
- Higher expenses or unexpected costs
- 20-30% probability, used for risk planning

Optimistic Case:
- Higher revenue/faster collections
- Payment term extensions
- Lower expenses or deferred CapEx
- 20-30% probability, used for upside planning
```

### Step 5: Weekly Cash Forecast (13-week rolling)
```
Week-by-week cash forecast:

Beginning Cash: $[X]
+ Collections: $[Y]
- Payroll: $[Z]
- Vendor payments: $[A]
- Debt service: $[B]
- Other disbursements: $[C]
= Ending Cash: $[D]

Minimum cash required: $[E]
Excess/(Deficit): $[F]

Update weekly:
- Replace forecast with actuals as weeks complete
- Add new week 13
- Revise assumptions based on actual trends
- Flag potential cash shortfalls
```

   - Identify systematic forecast bias
   - Refine assumptions continuously

3. **Scenario Planning**
   - Always maintain base, stressed, and optimistic cases
   - Stress test key assumptions (collections slow, revenue miss)
   - Model covenant compliance under stress
   - Plan for downside scenarios

4. **Working Capital Optimization**
   - Accelerate collections (billing timeliness, follow-up)
   - Optimize payment timing (use full terms, early payment discounts)
   - Minimize inventory (just-in-time, demand forecasting)
   - Negotiate favorable payment terms

5. **Communication**
   - Regular cash reporting to CFO/CEO
   - Alert stakeholders to potential shortfalls early
   - Provide recommended actions (delay CapEx, accelerate fundraising)
   - Maintain transparency on assumptions

## Common Cash Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cash Runway Analysis
**Situation**: Startup needs to know runway and when to fundraise
**Analysis**:
```
Current cash: $10M
Monthly burn rate: $800K
Runway: 12.5 months

Recommended Actions:
- Begin fundraising at 12 months runway (NOW)
- Target close in 6 months = 6.5 months runway at close
- Raise 18-24 months of runway = $14-19M
- Implement cost reductions if fundraising takes longer
```

### Scenario 2: Working Capital Improvement
**Situation**: Negative cash flow despite profitability
**Analysis**:
```
Working Capital Metrics:
- DSO: 75 days (target: 45 days)
- DPO: 30 days (target: 45 days)
- CCC: 45 days (target: 0 days)

Improvement Opportunities:
1. Reduce DSO by 30 days: Frees up $[X]M cash
   - Tighten collections process
   - Offer early payment discounts
   - Require deposits on large orders

2. Increase DPO by 15 days: Retains $[Y]M cash
   - Negotiate extended terms with key vendors
   - Consolidate vendor base for better terms

Total Cash Impact: $[X+Y]M one-time improvement
```

### Scenario 3: Debt Covenant Compliance
**Situation**: Upcoming debt covenant test
**Analysis**:
```
Covenant: Minimum cash balance of $5M
Current forecast: $4.8M in Q3 (violation)

Mitigation Options:
1. Delay CapEx spend ($500K) to Q4
2. Extend vendor payment terms (adds $300K)
3. Accelerate collections on large invoices ($400K)
4. Draw on revolver ($1M backup)

Recommended Approach:
- Implement options 1-3 (total $1.2M improvement)
- Maintain revolver availability as backup
- Notify lender proactively
```

## Cash Flow Improvement Strategies

### Accelerate Collections
- **Invoice Promptly**: Bill immediately upon delivery
- **Tighten Payment Terms**: Net 30 vs. Net 60
- **Early Payment Discounts**: 2% discount for payment in 10 days
- **Automated Reminders**: Email reminders at 15, 30, 45 days
- **Proactive Follow-Up**: Call large accounts before due date
- **Electronic Payments**: Enable ACH, credit card for faster payment
- **Deposits/Prepayments**: Require 50% upfront on large projects

### Optimize Disbursements
- **Use Full Payment Terms**: Pay on day 30 of Net 30, not early
- **Negotiate Extended Terms**: Request Net 45 or Net 60 from vendors
- **Consolidate Vendors**: Better terms with larger volume
- **Take Early Payment Discounts When Attractive**: 2/10 Net 30 = 36% annualized return
- **Pay Large Bills by Credit Card**: Extra 30 days float (if no fees)
- **Batch Payments**: Reduce transaction fees and bank time

### Reduce Working Capital
- **Inventory Optimization**: Reduce safety stock, improve forecasting
- **Drop Shipping**: Avoid holding inventory
- **Just-in-Time Purchasing**: Order closer to need date
- **Consignment Inventory**: Supplier holds inventory until use

## Risk Management

### Cash Flow Risks
- **Revenue Shortfall**: Lower than expected sales
  - Mitigation: Conservative revenue assumptions, multiple scenarios
- **Collection Delays**: Customers pay late or not at all
  - Mitigation: Credit checks, deposits, diversified customer base
- **Unexpected Expenses**: Unplanned costs arise
  - Mitigation: Contingency reserves, expense controls
- **Covenant Violations**: Breach debt covenants
  - Mitigation: Proactive monitoring, early communication with lenders

### Early Warning Indicators
- A/R aging deteriorating (DSO increasing)
- Large customers requesting extended terms
- Increasing use of revolving credit
- Approaching minimum cash covenants
- Lengthening time to pay vendors
