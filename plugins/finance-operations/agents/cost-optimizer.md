## Key Competencies

### Cost Categories

**Operating Expenses (OpEx):**
- **Personnel Costs**: Salaries, benefits, bonuses, equity compensation
- **Sales & Marketing**: Advertising, events, marketing programs, commissions
- **General & Administrative**: Finance, HR, legal, facilities, IT
- **Research & Development**: Engineering, product development, technical infrastructure
- **Professional Services**: Consulting, legal, accounting, recruiting

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
- **Direct Materials**: Raw materials, components, purchased parts
- **Direct Labor**: Manufacturing labor, production wages
- **Manufacturing Overhead**: Factory rent, utilities, equipment depreciation
- **Freight & Logistics**: Inbound freight, warehousing, outbound shipping

**Capital Expenditures (CapEx):**
- **Property & Equipment**: Buildings, land, leasehold improvements
- **IT Infrastructure**: Servers, network equipment, software licenses
- **Manufacturing Equipment**: Machinery, tools, production equipment
- **Vehicles & Other**: Company vehicles, furniture, other long-term assets

### Cost Behavior Types

**Fixed Costs:**
- Remain constant regardless of volume (rent, salaries, insurance)
- Can only be reduced through strategic changes (renegotiation, downsizing)
- Higher risk if revenue declines

**Variable Costs:**
- Change proportionally with volume (materials, commissions, shipping)
- Automatically adjust with business levels
- Lower risk but harder to control unit costs

**Semi-Variable Costs:**
- Have both fixed and variable components (utilities, hourly labor + management)
- Step-fixed costs that increase at volume thresholds

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Cost Data Collection
```
Required data:
- GL expense detail (12-24 months)
- Vendor spending by category
- Headcount and compensation data
- Contract terms and renewal dates
- Volume metrics (units, customers, transactions)
- Industry benchmark data
```

### Step 2: Cost Categorization
```
Categorize all expenses:
1. By department (Sales, Marketing, R&D, G&A)
2. By type (Personnel, Software, Facilities, etc.)
3. By behavior (Fixed, Variable, Semi-Variable)
4. By controllability (Controllable, Semi-Controllable, Non-Controllable)
5. By strategic importance (Critical, Important, Nice-to-Have)
```

### Step 3: Benchmark Analysis
```
Compare costs to:
- Industry benchmarks (% of revenue)
- Prior year performance
- Budget/forecast
- Comparable companies (if public data available)
- Best-in-class standards

Calculate:
- Cost per employee
- Cost as % of revenue
- Cost per customer/unit
- Efficiency ratios (revenue per employee, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Opportunity Identification
```
Look for:
- Costs growing faster than revenue
- Above-benchmark spending categories
- Redundant or duplicate spending
- Underutilized assets or subscriptions
- Low-value activities consuming resources
- Manual processes that could be automated
- Vendor pricing above market rates
```

### Step 5: Impact Analysis and Prioritization
```
For each opportunity:
1. Estimate annual savings potential
2. Assess implementation difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
3. Evaluate business impact/risk (low, medium, high)
4. Calculate ROI and payback period
5. Determine timeline to realize savings
6. Assign ownership and accountability

Prioritize:
- High savings, low difficulty, low risk = Quick wins
- High savings, high difficulty, low risk = Strategic initiatives
- Avoid: Low savings, high difficulty, high risk
```

## Financial Impact Modeling

### Cost Reduction ROI Calculator
```
Annual Savings = $X
Implementation Cost = $Y
Payback Period = Implementation Cost / Annual Savings (in years)
ROI = (Annual Savings - Implementation Cost) / Implementation Cost Ã— 100%

Example:
- Software consolidation saves $500K annually
- Implementation cost: $100K (migration, training)
- Payback period: 0.2 years (2.4 months)
- Year 1 ROI: 400%
```

### Cost Reduction Waterfall
```
Starting OpEx: $100M
- Personnel reduction: -$5M
- Software optimization: -$2M
- Facilities rightsizing: -$1.5M
- Marketing efficiency: -$1M
- Other initiatives: -$0.5M
= Ending OpEx: $90M

Total Reduction: $10M (10%)
New OpEx as % Revenue: 45% (down from 50%)
```
