# Management Reporting Skill

## Overview
This skill covers report design principles, KPI selection, executive communication, data visualization, and best practices for creating clear, actionable management reports.

## Core Principles

### Purpose of Management Reporting
Management reports provide stakeholders with:
- Financial performance visibility
- Progress toward goals and targets
- Early warning of issues requiring attention
- Data-driven insights for decision-making
- Accountability and performance tracking

### Key Audiences

**Board of Directors:**
- High-level strategic focus
- Quarterly financial results
- Key metrics and trends
- Forward-looking guidance
- Risk and opportunities
- Major decisions requiring approval

**Executive Team (CEO, CFO, COO):**
- Balanced detail level
- Monthly financial results
- Operational metrics
- Variance explanations
- Department performance
- Action items and decisions

**Department Leaders:**
- Department-specific detail
- Budget vs. actual performance
- Team metrics (headcount, productivity)
- Project status
- Resource needs

**Finance Team:**
- Full financial detail
- Account-level variances
- Reconciliations and close status
- Technical accounting issues
- Audit preparation

## Report Design Principles

### 1. Lead with Insights
```
Poor approach:
"Revenue was $5M in January"

Better approach:
"Revenue exceeded plan by 8% driven by strong enterprise bookings"

Best approach:
"Revenue of $5.2M exceeded plan by $400K (8%) driven by three large
enterprise deals closing earlier than expected. This strength is expected
to continue in Q1, recommend raising full-year guidance by $2M."
```

### 2. Use the Pyramid Principle
```
Structure (top-down):

Executive Summary (1 page)
â†“
Key Findings (2-3 pages)
â†“
Supporting Detail (5-10 pages)
â†“
Appendix (as needed)

Reader can stop at any level based on detail needs
```

### 3. Visualization Over Tables
```
When to use tables:
- Precise numbers needed
- Multiple dimensions to show
- Reference document

When to use charts:
- Showing trends over time â†’ Line chart
- Comparing categories â†’ Bar chart
- Showing composition â†’ Pie chart (sparingly)
- Showing variances â†’ Waterfall chart
- Showing relationships â†’ Scatter plot

Rule: If making a point, use a chart. If providing reference data, use a table.
```

### 4. Consistent Formatting
```
Standard elements:
- Company logo and branding
- Report title and period
- Date prepared
- Page numbers
- Consistent fonts and colors
- Standard templates

Color coding:
- Green: Favorable, on track, meeting targets
- Red: Unfavorable, off track, missing targets
- Yellow/Amber: Warning, at risk
- Blue/Gray: Neutral, reference data
```

## KPI Selection and Design

### SMART KPIs
```
Specific: Clearly defined metric
Measurable: Quantifiable data
Achievable: Realistic targets
Relevant: Aligned with strategic goals
Time-bound: Defined measurement period

Example:
Poor KPI: "Improve customer satisfaction"
SMART KPI: "Increase NPS from 40 to 50 by end of Q4"
```

### KPI Categories

**Financial KPIs:**
```
- Revenue (actual vs. budget/forecast)
- EBITDA and margin %
- Gross profit and margin %
- Operating cash flow
- Days of cash on hand
- Revenue per employee
- Magic number (for SaaS)
- Rule of 40 (Growth% + EBITDA%)
```

**Customer KPIs:**
```
- Customer count (active, new, churned)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV/CAC ratio (target 3:1+)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT)
```

**Operational KPIs:**
```
- Headcount (actual vs. plan)
- Revenue per employee
- Utilization rate (for services)
- Customer support metrics (response time, resolution rate)
- Product metrics (uptime, performance)
- Sales metrics (pipeline, win rate, quota attainment)
```

### KPI Dashboard Design
```
Elements:
1. Actual value
2. Target or budget
3. Variance ($ and %)
4. Trend arrow (â†‘ improving, â†“ declining, â†’ flat)
5. Sparkline (mini trend chart)
6. Status indicator (green/yellow/red)

Example:
Metric              Actual  Target  Var     Trend   Status
Revenue             $5.2M   $5.0M   +4%     â†‘       ðŸŸ¢
EBITDA              $0.8M   $1.0M   -20%    â†“       ðŸ”´
NRR                 108%    105%    +3pp    â†’       ðŸŸ¢
CAC Payback         18mo    18mo    0       â†’       ðŸŸ¢
```

## Data Visualization Best Practices

### Chart Type Selection

**Line Chart - Trends Over Time:**
```
Use for:
- Revenue by month/quarter
- Customer growth over time
- Metric trends (NPS, churn rate)
- Stock price or market data

Best practices:
- Y-axis starts at 0 (unless showing small variations)
- Use 2-4 lines maximum (more gets cluttered)
- Label lines directly vs. separate legend
- Show data points if few periods
```

**Column/Bar Chart - Comparisons:**
```
Use for:
- Revenue by product or segment
- Expense by department
- Performance across regions
- Ranking (top customers, largest expenses)

Best practices:
- Consistent color scheme
- Sort by value (largest to smallest) if no inherent order
- Show values on bars if not cluttered
- Use horizontal bars for long labels
```

**Waterfall Chart - Variance Breakdown:**
```
Use for:
- Budget to actual bridge
- Beginning to ending balance (cash, headcount)
- Revenue build-up (new + expansion - churn)

Example:
Starting Budget: $1,000K
+ Volume variance: +$100K (green)
+ Price variance: +$50K (green)
- Cost variance: ($80K) (red)
- Timing variance: ($20K) (red)
= Actual: $1,050K
```

**Pie Chart - Composition (Use Sparingly):**
```
Use for:
- Revenue mix by product (if 3-5 segments)
- Expense composition
- Market share

Avoid if:
- More than 5-6 slices (use bar chart instead)
- Showing trends (use stacked area chart)
- Need to compare precisely (use table)

Best practices:
- Largest slice at 12 o'clock
- Use contrasting colors
- Show percentage labels
```

**Combo Chart - Dual Metrics:**
```
Use for:
- Revenue (bars) and margin % (line)
- Customers (bars) and churn rate (line)
- Bookings (bars) and pipeline (line)

Best practices:
- Left axis for bars, right axis for line
- Clearly label both axes
- Use when metrics are related but different scales
```

### Color Usage
```
Standard palette:
- Primary brand color: Main data series
- Green: Positive, favorable, on track
- Red: Negative, unfavorable, at risk
- Yellow/Amber: Caution, warning
- Gray: Reference, prior year, benchmark

Accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient contrast
- Don't rely on color alone (use icons, patterns)
- Test for colorblind accessibility
```

## Writing Effective Commentary

### Variance Explanations
```
Poor explanation:
"Revenue was higher than budget"

Better explanation:
"Revenue exceeded budget by $500K (10%) due to timing of large enterprise deal"

Best explanation:
"Revenue of $5.5M exceeded budget by $500K (10%) driven by earlier-than-
expected close of $300K enterprise deal with Acme Corp and stronger-than-
planned SMB performance adding $200K. Enterprise timing is expected to
normalize in Feb; SMB strength likely sustainable. Full-year forecast
increased by $1M based on sustained SMB momentum."

Elements:
âœ“ Actual value
âœ“ Variance ($ and %)
âœ“ Root cause (specific)
âœ“ Business context (names, details)
âœ“ Forward-looking impact
âœ“ Action or recommendation
```

### Executive Summary Writing
```
Structure:
1. Bottom line up front (beat/miss, key takeaway)
2. Supporting evidence (metrics, facts)
3. Context and explanation (why)
4. Forward-looking implications (what it means)
5. Action or recommendation (what to do)

Example:
"We exceeded Q1 targets with revenue of $15M (+7% vs. plan) and EBITDA of
$3M (20% margin, +2pp vs. plan) driven by strong enterprise performance.
Notable wins included Acme Corp ($500K ACV) and TechCo ($300K ACV), both
closing ahead of forecast. Based on this momentum and a robust $25M
pipeline entering Q2, we are raising full-year guidance from $55M to $58M
revenue and $10M to $11M EBITDA. Key risk remains macro uncertainty
impacting deal cycles; we're monitoring closely and maintaining Q2
pipeline above 3x coverage. No board action required at this time."
```
