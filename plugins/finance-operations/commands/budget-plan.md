You are tasked with facilitating the annual budget planning and allocation process.

## Objective
Guide the organization through a comprehensive annual budgeting process that aligns financial plans with strategic objectives, ensures realistic targets, and creates accountability.

## Process

### 1. Budget Kickoff and Planning

**Define Budget Parameters:**
- Fiscal year being budgeted (e.g., "FY 2025")
- Budget time horizon (12 months, monthly detail)
- Strategic context and company goals
- Top-down revenue/EBITDA targets (if applicable)
- Major assumptions (market conditions, headcount, initiatives)

**Establish Timeline:**
```
Typical Budget Timeline (3-month process):

Month 1 - Planning and Assumptions:
Week 1-2: Budget kickoff, guidelines issued
Week 3-4: Revenue planning and assumptions
Week 4: Headcount plan finalized

Month 2 - Department Submissions:
Week 1-2: Department budget submissions
Week 3: Finance review and consolidation
Week 4: First executive review, feedback

Month 3 - Finalization:
Week 1-2: Revisions and iterations
Week 3: Final executive approval
Week 4: Board presentation and approval
```

**Communication:**
- Budget kickoff presentation
- Budget guidelines and templates
- Key assumptions and constraints
- Timeline and milestones
- Contact for questions

### 2. Revenue Budget Development

**Strategic Revenue Planning:**
- Overall revenue target (growth %)
- Revenue by segment, product, geography
- New vs. existing customer revenue
- Pricing strategy and assumptions
- Market assumptions

**Driver-Based Revenue Model:**
```
SaaS Example:

Beginning Customers: 1,000
+ New Customer Adds: 150/quarter × 4 = 600
- Churned Customers: 5% × average base = 80
= Ending Customers: 1,520

Average ARPU: $10,000
ARPU growth: 2% per quarter
Year-end ARPU: $10,824

Revenue Build:
Q1: 1,075 avg customers × $10,000 = $10.8M
Q2: 1,188 avg customers × $10,200 = $12.1M
Q3: 1,319 avg customers × $10,404 = $13.7M
Q4: 1,470 avg customers × $10,612 = $15.6M
Total FY: $52.2M (30% growth YoY)

Supporting Assumptions:
- Sales capacity: 20 reps × 30 deals/year = 600 deals
- Average deal size: $10,000 (consistent with ARPU)
- Win rate: 30%
- Pipeline required: 2,000 opportunities
```

**Revenue Validation:**
- Bottom-up (sales capacity) matches top-down target
- Market size and penetration realistic
- Comparison to industry benchmarks
- Prior year actuals and trends
- Known pipeline and backlog

### 3. Headcount Planning

**Department Headcount Budgets:**
```
For each department:

Beginning Headcount: XX FTE
+ Planned Hires: YY (by month/quarter)
- Expected Attrition: ZZ (based on historical %)
= Ending Headcount: AA FTE

Average Headcount (for expense calc): BB FTE

By Role/Level:
- Executives: X FTE @ $YYY avg
- Managers: X FTE @ $YYY avg
- ICs: X FTE @ $YYY avg
```

**Hiring Plan:**
- Open positions to backfill
- New positions to support growth
- Timing of hires (ramp throughout year)
- Recruiting timeline (time to fill)
- Compensation bands by role
- Geographic distribution (cost implications)

**Headcount Metrics:**
- Revenue per employee target
- Headcount as % of prior year
- Department headcount ratios
- Span of control (manager to IC ratio)

### 4. Expense Budget Development

**Personnel Expenses:**
```
For each department:

Salaries and Wages:
- Base headcount × average salary
- Planned raises (merit, promotion)
- New hire costs (partial year)

Benefits and Taxes:
- Salaries × benefit load % (typically 25-35%)
- Includes: health insurance, 401k match, payroll taxes

Bonuses:
- Target bonus % × eligible headcount
- Estimated achievement % (typically 100%)

Stock-Based Compensation:
- Existing grants (amortization schedule)
- New hire grants
- Annual refresh grants

Total Personnel = Salaries + Benefits + Bonuses + Stock Comp
```

**Non-Personnel Expenses:**
```
By category:

Software & Technology:
- Per-seat subscriptions × headcount
- Infrastructure costs (AWS, hosting)
- New tools or platform costs

Facilities:
- Rent (lease terms)
- Utilities
- Office supplies
- Maintenance

Marketing & Sales:
- Digital marketing (by channel)
- Events and conferences
- Content creation
- Sales tools and enablement

Professional Services:
- Legal (retainer + project)
- Accounting and audit
- Consulting engagements
- Recruiting fees

Travel & Entertainment:
- T&E per employee (by department)
- Sales travel (higher rate)
- Customer visits

Other:
- Insurance
- Training and development
- Miscellaneous
```

**CapEx Budget:**
- Equipment and hardware purchases
- Leasehold improvements
- Software licenses (capitalized)
- Major projects or initiatives

### 5. Budget Consolidation

**Compile Department Budgets:**
- Aggregate all department submissions
- Ensure consistency (eliminate double-counting)
- Validate intercompany allocations
- Roll up to company-level P&L

**Financial Statement Build:**
```
Income Statement:
- Revenue (by segment, product)
- COGS
- Gross Profit and Margin %
- Operating Expenses (by department)
- EBITDA and Margin %
- Depreciation & Amortization

- Net Income and Margin %

Balance Sheet:

- Debt schedule
- Cash and equity

Cash Flow Statement:

```

### 6. Budget Review and Iteration

**Feedback and Revisions:**

## Best Practices

**Process Best Practices:**
- Start 3-4 months before fiscal year
- Align budget to strategic plan
- Use driver-based models (customers, headcount)
- Iterate (don't expect one-pass perfection)
- Build in contingency/reserve for unknowns
- Scenario plan (base, aggressive, conservative)

**Assumption Documentation:**
- Document all major assumptions
- Link to strategic initiatives
- Validate with market data
- Update as conditions change
- Track assumptions vs. actuals

**Communication:**
- Clear guidelines and expectations
- Regular check-ins during process
- Transparent feedback on submissions
- Celebrate when complete
- Set expectations for variance tracking

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Sandbagging (overly conservative)
- Hockey stick (unrealistic growth)
- Forgetting investments needed for growth
- Under-estimating hiring time/cost
- Not modeling working capital/cash
- Ignoring prior year variance trends
