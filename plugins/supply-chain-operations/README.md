## Quick Start

### Example 1: Generate Demand Forecast

```
/demand-forecast "consumer electronics" "12 months"
```

This command will:
- Collect and prepare historical demand data
- Analyze demand patterns (trend, seasonality, variability)
- Select and apply appropriate forecasting methods
- Generate baseline forecast with accuracy metrics
- Incorporate business judgment and market intelligence
- Provide actionable recommendations for inventory planning

### Example 2: Optimize Inventory Policies

```
@inventory-optimizer Calculate optimal reorder points and safety stock for our top 100 SKUs
to achieve 95% service level. Current inventory is excessive.
```

The inventory-optimizer will:
- Analyze current inventory levels and turnover
- Calculate demand variability and lead times
- Determine EOQ and reorder points using service level targets
- Recommend safety stock levels balancing cost and service
- Provide expected inventory reduction and service improvement

### Example 3: Supplier Performance Review

```
/supplier-scorecard "ABC Manufacturing" "Q4 2024"
```

This generates a comprehensive scorecard with:
- Quality metrics (PPM, first pass yield, returns)
- Delivery performance (OTD, OTIF, lead time)
- Cost competitiveness and cost-down achievements
- Responsiveness and collaboration ratings
- Overall weighted score and performance tier
- Improvement recommendations or recognition

### Example 4: Logistics Optimization

```
@logistics-planner We have 150 customer orders to deliver in the northeast region
this week. Optimize our routing and carrier selection to minimize freight costs
while meeting delivery commitments.
```

The logistics-planner will:
- Analyze shipment characteristics and destinations
- Optimize routes for fleet deliveries (VRP)
- Select appropriate carriers and modes (TL, LTL, parcel)
- Identify consolidation opportunities
- Provide detailed shipment plan with cost and service KPIs
