# Supply Chain Risk Assessment

Systematic identification and assessment of supply chain risks with prioritized mitigation plans and contingency strategies.

## Context

Proactive risk assessment prevents disruptions, ensures business continuity, and protects against supplier failures, natural disasters, and operational issues.

## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Risk Identification
For $1 (scope), identify risks across categories: Supplier (financial, quality, capacity), Geographic (natural disasters, geopolitical), Operational (process, IT, labor), Demand (volatility, obsolescence), Regulatory (compliance, tariffs).

### 2. Risk Assessment
Evaluate each risk on Impact (1-5) and Likelihood (1-5). Calculate Risk Priority = Impact Ã— Likelihood. Prioritize High (>15) and Critical (>20) risks.

### 3. Supplier Financial Analysis
Assess top suppliers' financial health using credit ratings, D&B scores, financial ratios (current ratio, debt-to-equity, Z-score). Identify financially distressed suppliers.

### 4. Geographic and Concentration Analysis
Map supplier locations. Identify geographic concentration (single region >50% of spend). Assess natural disaster exposure, geopolitical risks. Calculate single-source dependencies.

### 5. Mitigation Planning
Develop strategies: Dual sourcing, safety stock buffers, supplier development, geographic diversification, business continuity plans. Assign owners and timelines.

## Output Format
1. Risk register with impact/likelihood scores
2. Supplier financial risk assessment
3. Geographic risk heat map
4. Mitigation plan for top 10 risks
5. Business continuity recommendations

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive risk catalog for $1
- Risk prioritization matrix completed
- Top 10 risks have mitigation plans
- Business continuity gaps identified
- Action plan ready for implementation
