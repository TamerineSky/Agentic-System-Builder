# Quarterly Supply Chain Performance Review

Comprehensive quarterly review of supply chain performance across cost, service, inventory, supplier, and quality dimensions with continuous improvement initiatives.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Assess supply chain performance against targets, identify improvement opportunities, and align stakeholders on priorities.
**Frequency**: Quarterly
**Participants**: Supply chain leadership, procurement, operations, logistics, quality, finance
**Outcomes**: Performance scorecard, root cause analysis of gaps, improvement action plan

## Orchestration Workflow

### Week 1: Data Collection and Metric Calculation

**Inventory Performance**
- inventory-optimizer: /inventory-status: Comprehensive inventory analysis
- Calculate: Inventory turnover (quarterly and YTD), Days on hand by category, Inventory value and composition (raw, WIP, finished), Excess and obsolete inventory, Stockout frequency and fill rate

**Supplier Performance**
- supplier-relationship-manager: /supplier-scorecard: Generate scorecards for all strategic suppliers
- Aggregate: Overall supplier performance score, Quality metrics (PPM, first pass yield), Delivery metrics (OTD, OTIF), Cost performance (price changes, cost-down), Top performers and underperformers

**Logistics Performance**
- logistics-planner: Calculate transportation KPIs
- Metrics: Freight cost per unit shipped, On-time delivery %, Freight cost as % of sales, Cube/weight utilization, Carrier performance scores

**Quality Performance**
- quality-control-analyst: /quality-analysis: Analyze quality trends
- Metrics: First pass yield, Scrap and rework rate, Cost of poor quality, Customer returns and complaints, Process capability (Cpk) for critical processes

**Cost Performance**
- procurement-advisor: /procurement-analysis: Spend analysis and savings
- Metrics: Total supply chain cost as % of revenue, Procurement savings achieved vs. target, Cost variance by category, Budget adherence

### Week 2: Performance Analysis and Benchmarking

**Variance Analysis**
- Compare actual vs. target for all key metrics
- Identify significant variances (>10% from target or budget)
- Trend analysis: Compare to previous quarters, YoY comparison, Multi-year trends

**Benchmarking**
- Compare performance to industry benchmarks: Inventory turns (by industry), Fill rate standards, Freight cost ratios, Quality levels (PPM), Supplier performance norms
- Identify gaps to best-in-class

**Root Cause Analysis**
- For major variances and misses: Why did we miss inventory target? Why did supplier performance decline? Why did freight costs increase?
- Use 5 Whys, fishbone, or data analysis
- Categorize root causes (process, system, resource, external)

### Week 3: Improvement Planning

**Prioritize Improvement Opportunities**
- Rank opportunities by: Financial impact (cost savings or revenue protection), Strategic importance, Feasibility and timeline
- Apply Pareto principle (focus on vital few)

**Develop Initiatives**
- For each priority opportunity: Define specific improvement goal, Assign owner and cross-functional team, Create action plan with milestones, Estimate financial benefit, Set success metrics

**Example Initiatives**
- Inventory optimization: /reorder-calc for top 100 SKUs to reduce excess
- Supplier improvement: Develop bottom quartile suppliers or replace
- Logistics optimization: /logistics-plan to consolidate LTL shipments
- Quality improvement: Six Sigma project on top defect types
- Procurement savings: Strategic sourcing for high-spend categories

**Resource Planning**
- Identify resource needs (people, budget, tools)
- Prioritize and sequence initiatives
- Secure executive sponsorship and funding

### Week 4: Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Meeting

**QBR Agenda (2-3 hours)**

**1. Executive Summary (15 min)**
- Overall supply chain performance (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Key achievements and wins
- Major challenges and misses
- Priorities for next quarter

**2. Performance Scorecard Review (45 min)**
- Inventory performance vs. targets
- Supplier performance trends
- Logistics cost and service
- Quality metrics and issues
- Cost performance and savings

**3. Deep Dive Topics (45 min)**
- Select 2-3 areas for detailed review: Major variances requiring explanation, Emerging risks or opportunities, Strategic initiatives update
- Present data, root causes, and recommendations
- Facilitate discussion and alignment

**4. Improvement Initiatives (30 min)**
- Review ongoing initiatives (status, results)
- Present new initiatives from improvement planning
- Prioritize and approve initiatives
- Assign resources and owners

**5. Decisions and Next Steps (15 min)**
- Document key decisions
- Confirm action items and owners
- Set expectations for next quarter
- Address questions and concerns

**QBR Participants**
- Supply chain leadership (host)
- Procurement, operations, logistics, quality directors
- Finance (cost and investment review)
- Sales/commercial (customer impact perspective)
- Executive sponsor (VP or C-level)

### Post-QBR Actions

**Communication**
- Distribute QBR summary to stakeholders
- Share performance results with teams
- Communicate improvement priorities

**Execution Tracking**
- Launch approved improvement initiatives
- Track action items from QBR
- Monitor performance monthly between QBRs

**Continuous Monitoring**
- Monthly performance dashboards
- Early warning alerts for off-track metrics
- Mid-quarter check-ins as needed

## Key Metrics by Dimension

**Inventory**
- Inventory turnover (COGS / Avg inventory)
- Days on hand (Inventory / Daily sales)
- Fill rate (Demand satisfied / Total demand)
- Excess inventory value
- Stockout frequency

**Supplier**
- Weighted supplier performance score
- On-time delivery % (target >95%)
- Quality PPM (target varies by industry)
- Cost savings delivered
- Supplier risk score

**Logistics**
- Freight cost per unit
- On-time delivery % (target >95%)
- Freight cost as % of sales
- Carrier performance score
- Average transit time

**Quality**
- First pass yield (target >99%)
- Scrap rate (target <2%)
- Cost of poor quality
- Customer return rate
- Process Cpk (target >1.33)

**Cost**
- Total supply chain cost % of revenue
- Procurement savings $ and %
- Budget variance
- Working capital (inventory + AR - AP)
- Cash-to-cash cycle time

## Success Criteria

- QBR completed on schedule each quarter
- All key metrics calculated and reported
- Root causes identified for major variances
- 3-5 improvement initiatives defined and approved
- Action items have owners and due dates
- Performance improving quarter-over-quarter
