# Comprehensive Supplier Evaluation Process

Structured workflow for evaluating, scoring, and selecting suppliers including financial, operational, quality, and risk assessment.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Rigorously evaluate suppliers for strategic sourcing decisions or supplier qualification.
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks
**Participants**: Procurement, quality, engineering, operations, finance
**Outcomes**: Supplier scorecard, risk assessment, recommendation (approve/reject/develop)

## Orchestration Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Screening

**Data Collection**
- Gather supplier information: Company profile, financial statements, certifications, references, capabilities overview
- Conduct preliminary financial review (credit rating, public filings)
- Review quality certifications (ISO 9001, industry-specific)

**Go/No-Go Decision**
- Assess basic qualifications: Financial stability (not in distress), Relevant capabilities, No disqualifying factors (ethics violations, sanctions)
- Proceed only if passes initial screening

### Phase 2: Financial and Risk Assessment

**Financial Analysis**
- procurement-advisor: Analyze financial health using D&B report, credit rating, financial ratios
- Calculate key ratios: Current ratio (liquidity), Debt-to-equity (leverage), Z-score (bankruptcy risk)
- Review payment terms and financial stability

**Risk Assessment**
- /risk-assessment: Evaluate supplier risks
- Assess: Financial risk (distress probability), Operational risk (capacity, process maturity), Geographic risk (location vulnerabilities), Compliance risk (regulations, certifications)
- Calculate risk score and prioritize concerns

**Business Continuity Review**
- Evaluate disaster recovery and business continuity plans
- Assess single-source dependencies and backup capacity
- Review insurance and risk mitigation strategies

### Phase 3: Operational and Quality Assessment

**Site Assessment (Virtual or On-site)**
- quality-control-analyst: Conduct supplier audit
- Evaluate: Manufacturing processes and equipment, Quality management system, Production capacity and scalability, Warehouse and logistics capabilities, IT systems and data integration
- Document findings and gaps

**Quality Capability**
- /quality-analysis: Assess process capability
- Review historical quality performance (PPM, first pass yield)
- Conduct process capability studies (Cpk for critical characteristics)
- Evaluate continuous improvement culture (Six Sigma, lean)
- Review customer complaint and corrective action history

**Capacity and Flexibility**
- Assess current capacity utilization and headroom
- Evaluate ability to scale (equipment, labor, materials)
- Test responsiveness to changes (lead time flexibility, engineering changes)
- Review capacity planning and investment plans

### Phase 4: Cost and Commercial Evaluation

**Total Cost of Ownership**
- /cost-breakdown: Calculate TCO beyond unit price
- Include: Unit price, Freight and logistics, Duties and compliance, Quality costs (defects, returns), Payment terms impact, Transaction costs
- Compare TCO across suppliers

**Should-Cost Analysis**
- procurement-advisor: Build should-cost model
- Bottom-up cost estimation: Materials, Labor, Overhead, Margin
- Compare supplier quote to should-cost
- Identify cost gaps and negotiation opportunities

**Commercial Terms**
- Evaluate: Payment terms and discounts, Volume commitments and flexibility, Price escalation clauses, Contract duration and renewal terms, Performance incentives/penalties

### Phase 5: Supplier Scorecard and Decision

**Comprehensive Scoring**
- /supplier-scorecard: Generate weighted scorecard
- Dimensions with example weights:
  - Quality (30%): Process capability, quality history, certifications
  - Delivery (20%): Lead time, on-time performance, flexibility
  - Cost (25%): TCO competitiveness, cost structure, commercial terms
  - Risk (15%): Financial health, geographic risk, business continuity
  - Capability (10%): Capacity, technology, innovation, scalability

**Benchmarking**
- Compare scores across candidate suppliers
- Benchmark against incumbent or industry standards
- Assess cost-service-risk trade-offs

**Final Recommendation**
- supplier-relationship-manager: Synthesize findings
- Recommend decision: **Approve**: High scores, acceptable risk, move to production
  **Approve with Development**: Good potential, specific gaps to address
  **Conditionally Approve**: Medium risk, requires monitoring and contingency
  **Reject**: Low scores, unacceptable risk, poor fit

**Development Plan (if needed)**
- Define improvement areas and targets
- Establish timeline and milestones
- Assign responsibilities (supplier and internal)
- Schedule follow-up assessments

### Phase 6: Implementation

**Supplier Onboarding**
- Execute contracts and agreements
- Configure supplier in ERP and procurement systems
- Establish communication channels and escalation paths
- Conduct kick-off meeting

**Performance Monitoring**
- Implement supplier scorecard with monthly tracking
- Schedule regular business reviews (quarterly for strategic)
- Define KPIs and thresholds for escalation
- Monitor risk factors (financial, operational, market)

## Evaluation Criteria Examples

**Quality (30%)**
- Process capability (Cpk) for critical characteristics
- Historical defect rate (PPM)
- Quality certifications (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, etc.)
- Customer complaint rate
- Continuous improvement programs

**Delivery (20%)**
- Quoted lead time competitiveness
- On-time delivery track record
- Lead time variability
- Flexibility to expedite or adjust
- Supply chain visibility

**Cost (25%)**
- Total cost of ownership vs. alternatives
- Unit price competitiveness vs. should-cost
- Payment terms (early pay discount, net terms)
- Cost reduction roadmap
- Total value proposition

**Risk (15%)**
- Financial health (credit rating, ratios, Z-score)
- Geographic concentration and disaster exposure
- Single-source dependency level
- Business continuity preparedness
- Compliance and ethical standards

**Capability (10%)**
- Current capacity utilization
- Scalability (can grow with our needs)
- Technical capabilities and innovation
- IT systems and integration readiness
- Cultural fit and collaboration

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive evaluation across all dimensions
- Data-driven scoring and decision-making
- Risk mitigation plans for approved suppliers
- Clear rationale for decision (documented)
- Supplier ready for production or development program initiated
