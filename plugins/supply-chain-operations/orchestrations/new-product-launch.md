# New Product Launch Supply Chain Workflow

End-to-end supply chain coordination for new product introduction from planning through ramp-up.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Ensure supply chain readiness for new product launch with demand forecast, supplier qualification, inventory positioning, and logistics.
**Timeline**: 6-9 months pre-launch through 3 months post-launch
**Participants**: Product management, demand planning, procurement, quality, logistics, suppliers
**Outcomes**: Launch forecast, qualified suppliers, inventory in place, flawless execution

## Orchestration Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (6-9 months pre-launch)

**Demand Forecasting**
- demand-forecaster: Build new product forecast using analogous product methods, market research, test market results
- /demand-forecast: Generate launch curve (ramp, peak, sustaining demand)
- Create scenarios (optimistic, base, pessimistic) given launch uncertainty
- Define forecast review cadence (monthly updates as launch approaches)

**Supply Chain Risk Assessment**
- /risk-assessment: Identify risks (supplier qualification, lead times, capacity, quality)
- Develop mitigation plans (dual sourcing, buffer inventory, expedited options)
- Map critical path dependencies

**Supplier Strategy**
- procurement-advisor: Define sourcing strategy (existing vs. new suppliers)
- /procurement-analysis: Conduct make-vs-buy analysis for key components
- Develop supplier qualification timeline

### Phase 2: Supplier Qualification (4-6 months pre-launch)

**Supplier Selection**
- procurement-advisor: Issue RFQs to qualified suppliers
- Evaluate proposals on cost, quality, capacity, lead time, risk
- Select suppliers and negotiate contracts

**Quality Validation**
- quality-control-analyst: Define quality requirements and acceptance criteria
- Conduct supplier audits and process capability studies
- Run pilot production and first article inspection
- /quality-analysis: Validate process capability (Cpk > 1.33)
- Approve suppliers for production

**Supplier Relationship Establishment**
- supplier-relationship-manager: Onboard suppliers
- Establish communication protocols and scorecards
- Define escalation procedures and business continuity plans

### Phase 3: Inventory Build (2-3 months pre-launch)

**Inventory Planning**
- inventory-optimizer: Calculate launch inventory requirements
- /reorder-calc: Determine safety stock for demand uncertainty
- Plan inventory phasing (pre-build, launch stock, replenishment)
- Balance stockout risk vs. obsolescence risk

**Procurement Execution**
- Place initial orders with lead time consideration
- Expedite critical components if needed
- Monitor supplier production and on-time delivery
- /supplier-scorecard: Track quality and delivery performance

**Logistics Planning**
- logistics-planner: Design distribution strategy (DCs, stock allocation)
- /logistics-plan: Plan inbound and outbound transportation
- Position inventory at regional DCs for fast delivery

### Phase 4: Launch Execution (Launch month)

**Launch Readiness**
- Confirm inventory in place at all distribution points
- Validate quality of stock (final inspection if needed)
- Brief sales and operations on launch plans
- Activate logistics for first shipments

**Demand Monitoring**
- Track actual demand vs. forecast daily
- Identify early signals (higher/lower than expected, geographic differences)
- Escalate significant variances immediately

**Supply Response**
- Adjust production and procurement based on actual demand signals
- Expedite if demand exceeds forecast
- Manage excess inventory if demand below forecast

### Phase 5: Post-Launch Stabilization (1-3 months post-launch)

**Forecast Refinement**
- demand-forecaster: Update forecast based on actual launch performance
- Refine demand model with real data
- Reduce uncertainty bands as pattern emerges

**Supply Chain Optimization**
- inventory-optimizer: Optimize safety stock as demand stabilizes
- /abc-analysis: Incorporate new product into inventory segmentation
- Transition from launch mode to steady-state operations

**Performance Review**
- Assess launch success: Forecast accuracy, Service level (stockouts), Inventory excess/shortage, Supplier performance, Cost vs. budget
- Document lessons learned
- Capture best practices for future launches

## Key Decisions

- Launch timing (go/no-go based on readiness)
- Inventory investment level (balance stockout vs. obsolescence)
- Geographic launch sequence (phased vs. full market)
- Supply base selection (single vs. multi-source)
- Contingency activation (when to trigger backup plans)

## Collaboration Points

- Product Management ↔ demand-forecaster: Market insights to forecast
- Procurement ↔ supplier-relationship-manager: Supplier qualification
- Quality ↔ quality-control-analyst: Validation and acceptance
- Operations ↔ inventory-optimizer: Inventory positioning
- Logistics ↔ logistics-planner: Distribution execution

## Success Metrics

- Forecast accuracy in first 3 months
- Service level (% of demand satisfied without stockout)
- Inventory turns (avoid excess buildup)
- Supplier quality and delivery performance
- On-time launch (no supply chain delays)
