# Supply Chain Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Systematic approaches to identifying, assessing, and mitigating supply chain risks including supplier financial health, operational disruptions, and geographic vulnerabilities.

## When to Use This Skill

- Conducting supplier risk assessments
- Evaluating single-source dependencies
- Planning business continuity and disaster recovery
- Assessing geographic concentration and geopolitical risks
- Monitoring supplier financial health
- Developing risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans
- Prioritizing risk management efforts by impact and likelihood

## Core Concepts

### Risk Categories

**Supplier Risk**: Financial instability, quality issues, capacity constraints
**Geographic Risk**: Natural disasters, geopolitical instability, trade policies
**Operational Risk**: Process failures, IT outages, labor disruptions
**Demand Risk**: Forecast error, market volatility, product obsolescence
**Regulatory Risk**: Compliance violations, environmental regulations

### Risk Assessment Matrix

```
Risk = Impact × Likelihood

        Low      Medium    High
       Impact    Impact   Impact
High    Medium    High    Critical
Likely
Medium  Low      Medium    High
Likely
Low     Low       Low     Medium
Likely
```

Prioritize **Critical** and **High** risks for mitigation.

## Methodologies

### Supplier Financial Risk

**Credit Rating Analysis**:
- Dun & Bradstreet scores
- Credit ratings (Moody's, S&P)
- Payment behavior (DSO, payment defaults)

**Financial Ratio Analysis**:
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Target: >1.5 (indicates liquidity)

Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Shareholder Equity
Target: <2.0 (not overleveraged)

Z-Score (Altman) = Bankruptcy prediction
Z > 2.99: Safe zone
1.81 < Z < 2.99: Gray zone
Z < 1.81: Distress zone
```

### Single-Source Risk Assessment

**Concentration Analysis**:
```
Supplier Concentration = Spend with Top Supplier / Total Spend

>50%: High risk (single-source dependency)
30-50%: Moderate risk
<30%: Low risk (diversified supply base)
```

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Dual sourcing (primary + backup)
- Strategic inventory buffer
- Supplier development to improve reliability
- Qualifying alternative suppliers

### Geographic Risk Mapping

**Risk Exposure**:
- Map supplier locations
- Identify concentration in high-risk regions
- Assess natural disaster exposure (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods)
- Evaluate geopolitical instability

**Diversification Strategy**:
- Multi-region sourcing
- Near-shore vs. off-shore balance
- Redundant capacity in different geographies

### Business Continuity Planning

**FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)**:
```
Risk Priority Number (RPN) = Severity × Occurrence × Detection

Severity: Impact (1-10 scale)
Occurrence: Likelihood (1-10 scale)
Detection: Ability to detect before impact (1-10 scale)

High RPN (>100): Requires action plan
```

**Contingency Plans**:
- Backup suppliers (qualified and ready)
- Safety stock for critical components
- Alternative transportation modes
- Cross-training and flexible workforce

## Resources

- **Risk platforms**: Resilinc, Dun & Bradstreet, RapidRatings
- **Standards**: ISO 31000 Risk Management, ISO 22301 Business Continuity
- **Books**: "The Resilient Enterprise" by Sheffi

## Common Pitfalls

- Focusing only on financial risk, ignoring operational and geographic
- No contingency plans despite identifying risks
- Static risk assessments not updated as conditions change
- Relying on single-source suppliers for critical components
- Inadequate communication with suppliers about risk mitigation
