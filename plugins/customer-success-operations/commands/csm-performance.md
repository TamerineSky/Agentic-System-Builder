# CSM Performance Command

Comprehensive CSM performance review with portfolio analysis and development planning.

## Context
Fair, data-driven CSM performance measurement enables effective coaching, resource optimization, and team development.

## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Performance Data
For CSM $1 in $2 period: Portfolio metrics (account count, total ARR, health distribution), retention outcomes (logo churn, revenue churn, GRR), expansion results (expansion ARR, NRR, opportunities closed), activity levels (touchpoints, QBRs, response times), customer satisfaction (portfolio NPS, CSAT, escalations).

### 2. Calculate Performance Scores
Score categories (0-100): Portfolio Health (avg health score, green/yellow/red distribution), Retention (churn vs. target, save play success rate), Expansion (quota attainment, deal size, close rate), Activity (touchpoint frequency, QBR completion, responsiveness), Customer Satisfaction (NPS, CSAT, escalation rate), Efficiency (time-to-value, admin time, meeting productivity). Compute overall performance score: weighted average.

### 3. Analyze Portfolio Balance
Assess workload: Account count vs. target, ARR concentration and risk, Customer health distribution, At-risk account load (red/yellow count), Complexity score (segment mix, strategic account burden).

### 4. Benchmark Performance
Compare to: Team averages (all metrics), Top performer benchmarks, Individual historical performance (trending), Segment/tier expectations (context-specific).

### 5. Identify Strengths and Gaps
Strengths: Top quartile performance areas, Consistent excellence over time, Best practices to share with team. Development Opportunities: Performance gaps vs. target, Declining trends requiring intervention, Skill development areas.

### 6. Create Development Plan
Recommendations: Priority 1-3 coaching focus areas, Specific actions and timelines, Shadowing/training opportunities, Resource allocation adjustments (portfolio rebalancing), Goal setting (30/60/90 day targets).

## Output Format
- Overall performance score and rating (vs. team average, vs. previous period)
- Performance by category (portfolio health, retention, expansion, activity, satisfaction, efficiency)
- Portfolio analysis (balance, workload, complexity)
- Trending (improving/declining areas over time)
- Strengths to leverage and recognize
- Development opportunities prioritized
- Coaching plan (focus areas, actions, timeline, expected impact)
- 30/60/90 day performance goals
- Career development considerations

## Success Criteria
- Analysis completed in 20-30 minutes per CSM
- All performance dimensions scored objectively
- Portfolio context considered (not just raw outcomes)
- Strengths and gaps identified with evidence
- Coaching plan specific and actionable
- Goals realistic and measurable
- Balanced (recognize strengths, develop gaps constructively)
