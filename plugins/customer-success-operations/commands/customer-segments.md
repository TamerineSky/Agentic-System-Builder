# Customer Segments Command

Create actionable customer segmentation framework with engagement strategies.

## Context
Effective segmentation enables personalized engagement, resource optimization, and improved outcomes (20-30% retention improvement with segment-specific playbooks).

## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Define Segmentation Approach
Use $1 methodology (value-based/ARR tiers, behavioral/usage patterns, health-risk status, lifecycle stage, RFM analysis, hybrid multi-dimensional).

### 2. Collect Segmentation Data
Gather customer attributes: Firmographic (ARR, company size, industry), behavioral (usage, engagement, product adoption), outcome-based (health score, NPS, churn risk), lifecycle (tenure, onboarding status).

### 3. Create Segments
Apply segmentation logic: Value-based (Strategic >$50K, Growth $15-50K, Core $5-15K, Starter <$5K), Health-based (Champions green+expanding, Stable green+flat, At-Risk yellow, Critical red), Behavioral (Power users, Standard, At-risk, Dormant).

### 4. Analyze Segment Characteristics
For each segment: Calculate size (% of customers, % of ARR), measure outcomes (retention rate, NRR, churn rate, LTV), identify patterns (common behaviors, success factors, risks).

### 5. Design Segment Strategies
Define engagement models: High-touch (dedicated CSM, weekly cadence, strategic QBRs), Standard-touch (pooled CSM, bi-weekly cadence, quarterly reviews), Low-touch (monthly check-ins, semi-annual reviews), Tech-touch (automated, digital-only).

### 6. Develop Segment Playbooks
Create specific strategies: Champions (expansion focus, advocacy development), At-Risk (proactive intervention, health improvement), New/Onboarding (intensive activation, milestone tracking), Mature (renewal focus, sustained value).

## Output Format
- Segmentation framework overview (dimensions, logic, segments)
- Segment profiles (size, ARR, characteristics, outcomes)
- Segment performance comparison (retention, NRR, health, expansion)
- Engagement model by segment (CSM ratio, cadence, touchpoints)
- Resource allocation recommendations (CSM time, investment levels)
- Segment-specific playbooks and strategies
- Migration rules (segment transitions, triggers)
- Expected impact (efficiency gains, outcome improvements)

## Success Criteria
- Segmentation completed in 2-3 hours
- 3-6 meaningful, actionable segments defined
- Each segment has distinct characteristics and outcomes
- Engagement models practical and resource-aligned
- Playbooks specific and executable
- Migration rules clear and measurable
- Expected ROI quantified (retention, efficiency, NRR)
