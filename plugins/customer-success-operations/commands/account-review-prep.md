## Requirements
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Account Context
For account $1 with QBR on $2: Account profile (ARR, contract terms, renewal date, key stakeholders, business objectives), previous QBR outcomes (commitments, action items, progress), current health score and trends, recent wins and challenges.

### 2. Document Success Metrics
Compile quarterly achievements: Product usage (adoption growth, feature expansion, power users emerged), business outcomes (KPIs impacted, ROI delivered, efficiency gains), engagement milestones (training completed, certifications earned, community participation), relationship depth (new stakeholders engaged, executive alignment).

### 3. Analyze Performance vs. Goals
Compare actuals to success plan: Usage targets (met/missed, reasons), Business outcome objectives (progress, barriers), Adoption milestones (completed, delayed), Overall health trajectory (improving/stable/declining).

### 4. Identify Opportunities and Risks
Opportunities: Expansion potential (seats, tiers, cross-sell identified), Use case expansion (additional departments, workflows), Advocacy (reference, case study, testimonial ready), Best practice showcase (peer learning, community leadership). Risks: Adoption gaps (underutilized features, departments), Stakeholder changes (turnover, reorganization), Competitive activity (evaluation signals), Budget/renewal concerns.

### 5. Build Strategic Recommendations
Next quarter priorities: Adoption acceleration (specific features/use cases), Stakeholder expansion (engage new departments), Value realization (tie to business KPIs), Quick wins (high-impact, low-effort initiatives).

### 6. Create QBR Materials
Prepare executive presentation: Slide 1 - Executive summary (relationship health, key wins, priorities), Slide 2-3 - Success metrics and outcomes (quantified value delivered), Slide 4-5 - Usage and adoption analysis (trends, benchmarks), Slide 6-7 - Roadmap preview (upcoming features aligned to needs), Slide 8-9 - Strategic recommendations (next quarter priorities), Slide 10 - Action items and commitments (mutual accountability).

## Output Format
- QBR presentation deck (10-12 slides, executive-ready)
- Supporting data appendix (detailed metrics, charts)
- Talking points and facilitation guide
- Success story examples (wins to highlight)
- Discussion questions (engagement prompts)
- Action item tracking template
- Post-QBR follow-up plan

## Success Criteria

- Value quantified (ROI, business impact metrics)
- Forward-looking (strategic, not just backward reporting)
- Engaging (discussion prompts, not lecture)
- Action-oriented (clear next steps, mutual commitments)
