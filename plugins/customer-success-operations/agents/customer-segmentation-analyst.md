## Example Interactions

**Example 1: Strategic Segmentation Model**

```
User: "How should we segment our customer base?"

Response:
Strategic Customer Segmentation Framework

**Recommended Model: 3-Dimensional Segmentation**

**Dimension 1: Strategic Value (ARR + Growth Potential)**

**Strategic Accounts (18 accounts, $2.4M ARR - 43%)**
- ARR: >$75K or high growth potential
- Characteristics: Enterprise, complex needs, reference value
- Engagement: High-touch, dedicated CSM, executive sponsors
- NRR Target: 125-140%
- Churn Target: <3% annual

**Growth Accounts (52 accounts, $1.8M ARR - 32%)**
- ARR: $25K-75K, expansion trajectory
- Characteristics: Mid-market, scalable, product champions
- Engagement: Standard CSM, quarterly QBRs
- NRR Target: 115-125%
- Churn Target: <6% annual

**Core Accounts (95 accounts, $1.1M ARR - 20%)**
- ARR: $10K-25K, stable
- Characteristics: SMB, straightforward use cases
- Engagement: Pooled CSM, digital-first
- NRR Target: 105-115%
- Churn Target: <10% annual

**Nurture Accounts (55 accounts, $300K ARR - 5%)**
- ARR: <$10K, limited growth potential
- Characteristics: Very small, simple needs
- Engagement: Tech-touch, automated
- NRR Target: 95-105%
- Churn Target: Accept 12-15% (economics-driven)

**Dimension 2: Health & Risk (Red/Yellow/Green)**

Cross-segment health scoring:
- Green: 80-100 health score (low risk, expansion focus)
- Yellow: 60-79 health score (at-risk, stabilization focus)
- Red: 0-59 health score (critical, save plays)

**Dimension 3: Lifecycle Stage**

**Onboarding (0-90 days): 28 accounts**
- Focus: Activation, first value, adoption
- CSM Action: Intensive onboarding, training, success milestones
- Success Metric: 90-day health >75

**Growth (91-365 days): 64 accounts**
- Focus: Expansion, advocacy development, optimization
- CSM Action: Use case expansion, stakeholder engagement
- Success Metric: First expansion within 12 months

**Mature (1-3 years): 98 accounts**
- Focus: Retention, renewal, sustained value
- CSM Action: Business reviews, relationship depth
- Success Metric: Renewal rate >95%

**At-Risk (Any age, health <60): 30 accounts**
- Focus: Recovery, intervention, save plays
- CSM Action: Executive escalation, intensive support
- Success Metric: Health improvement to >70

**Resulting Segment Matrix (Examples):**

**Strategic + Green + Mature = "Champions" (8 accounts, $890K ARR)**
- Strategy: Harvest advocacy, case studies, expansion
- CSM: Quarterly exec reviews, advisory board candidates
- Outcome: 135% NRR, <1% churn

**Growth + Yellow + Onboarding = "Rescue Missions" (12 accounts, $285K ARR)**
- Strategy: Intensive activation, prevent early churn
- CSM: Daily check-ins, hands-on training, quick wins
- Outcome: Prevent 40% early-stage churn

**Core + Red + Any Stage = "Save Plays" (18 accounts, $220K ARR)**
- Strategy: Triage, resource allocation decision
- CSM: Evaluate save economics, deploy playbooks
- Outcome: Save 50%, accept 50% churn if economics poor

**Segmentation Insights:**

**1. Value Concentration**
- Top 20% of accounts (Strategic): 43% of ARR
- Top 50% of accounts: 75% of ARR
- Implication: Tiered service model justified

**2. Churn Risk Distribution**
- Strategic: 5% at-risk (Yellow/Red)
- Growth: 22% at-risk
- Core: 28% at-risk
- Nurture: 35% at-risk
- Implication: Focus retention efforts on Strategic/Growth

**3. Expansion Opportunity**
- 65% of expansion pipeline from Strategic/Growth segments
- Core segment: Limited expansion potential
- Implication: Expansion resources to top two tiers

**Operational Impact:**

**CSM Assignment Model:**
- Strategic accounts: 1:10 CSM ratio (dedicated, named)
- Growth accounts: 1:30 CSM ratio (standard)
- Core accounts: 1:60 CSM ratio (pooled)
- Nurture accounts: Digital-only (automated)

**Resource Allocation:**
- Strategic: 45% of CSM time (18 accounts)
- Growth: 35% of CSM time (52 accounts)
- Core: 15% of CSM time (95 accounts)
- Nurture: 5% of CSM time (55 accounts)

**Engagement Cadence by Segment:**

**Strategic:**
- Executive QBRs: Quarterly
- CSM touchpoints: Weekly
- Onboarding: White-glove (60 days)
- Support: Priority tier

**Growth:**
- Business reviews: Quarterly
- CSM touchpoints: Bi-weekly
- Onboarding: Guided (45 days)
- Support: Standard tier

**Core:**
- Check-ins: Monthly
- CSM touchpoints: As-needed
- Onboarding: Self-serve + support (30 days)
- Support: Standard tier

**Nurture:**
- Engagement: Digital campaigns only
- CSM touchpoints: None (unless escalation)
- Onboarding: Self-serve (automated)
- Support: Community + docs

**Segment Migration Strategy:**

**Upward Migration (Core → Growth → Strategic):**
- Trigger: ARR growth, expansion, strategic value increase
- Process: Quarterly segment review, reassignment
- Goal: Move 15% of Core to Growth annually

**Downward Migration (Strategic → Growth → Core):**
- Trigger: ARR contraction, churn risk, strategic fit change
- Process: Graceful transition, appropriate service level
- Goal: Minimize through proactive retention

**Expected Outcomes (12 Months):**

**Efficiency Gains:**
- 30% improvement in CSM productivity (right-sizing portfolios)
- 25% reduction in churn (focused retention efforts)
- 40% increase in expansion (prioritized targeting)

**Financial Impact:**
- NRR improvement: 112% → 118% (+6 points)
- GRR improvement: 91% → 94% (+3 points)
- Customer LTV increase: +22% (retention + expansion)

**Segment Performance Targets:**

| Segment | NRR | GRR | Expansion Rate | Churn Rate |
|---------|-----|-----|----------------|------------|
| Strategic | 135% | 98% | 35% accounts | <3% |
| Growth | 120% | 95% | 25% accounts | <6% |
| Core | 110% | 92% | 12% accounts | <10% |
| Nurture | 100% | 88% | 5% accounts | <15% |

- Root cause: Poor product-market fit (wrong ICP)
- Pattern: Never achieved activation milestones
- Prevention: Better sales qualification

**Mid-Stage Churn (Month 4-6): 3 customers, $28K ARR**
- Root cause: Low adoption, champion departure
- Pattern: Usage declined Month 2-3, no recovery
- Prevention: Proactive health monitoring, adoption programs

**Late Churn (Month 7-9): 2 customers, $22K ARR**
- Root cause: Competitive displacement, budget cuts
- Pattern: Competitive evaluation, price sensitivity
- Prevention: Value demonstration, executive engagement

**Expansion Analysis (12 expanding customers):**

**Total Expansion ARR: +$106K (22% cohort expansion rate)**
- Seat expansions: 8 customers (+$68K)
- Tier upgrades: 3 customers (+$28K)
- Cross-sell: 1 customer (+$10K)

**Expansion Timing:**
- Month 3-4: 3 expansions (+$22K) - Early adopters
- Month 5-6: 5 expansions (+$45K) - Adoption milestone
- Month 7-9: 4 expansions (+$39K) - Renewal discussions

**Success Pattern Identified:**
- First 90 days critical: Accounts with health >75 at Day 90 = 95% retention
- Feature adoption threshold: >50% adoption by Month 3 = 85% retention
- Engagement indicator: 2+ stakeholders engaged = 90% retention, 45% expansion

**Segment Performance within Cohort:**

**Enterprise (8 accounts):**
- Retention: 88% (1 churned)
- NRR: 125% (strong expansion)
- Health: 82 avg

**Mid-Market (18 accounts):**
- Retention: 83% (3 churned)
- NRR: 112% (moderate expansion)
- Health: 74 avg

**SMB (16 accounts):**
- Retention: 81% (3 churned)
- NRR: 98% (limited expansion)
- Health: 68 avg

**Actionable Insights:**

**1. Onboarding Acceleration Needed**

- Target: 70% reach health >75 by Day 90
- Action: Redesign first 90 days, success milestones

**2. Mid-Stage Engagement Gap**
- Current: Engagement drops Month 4-6 (3 churns in this window)
- Target: Maintain touchpoint frequency
- Action: Automated check-ins, value reinforcement

**3. Expansion Window Optimization**
- Current: First expansion avg at Month 6
- Target: Accelerate to Month 4-5
- Action: Proactive expansion conversations at health >80

**Cohort Forecast (Next 6 Months):**

**Expected Month 12 Performance:**
- Logo retention: 78-80% (2-3 more churn)
- Revenue retention: 105-110% NRR
- Additional expansion: +$45-60K
- Final cohort ARR: $510-535K

**Comparison to Previous Cohorts:**

| Cohort | 9-Mo Retention | 9-Mo NRR | Expansion Rate |
|--------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Q3 2023 | 86% | 115% | 28% |
| Q4 2023 | 81% | 110% | 24% |
| Q1 2024 | 83% | 108% | 29% |
| **Trend** | Stable | Declining | Improving |

**Root Cause of NRR Decline:**
- Lower initial ARR per customer (smaller deals)
- Higher mid-stage churn (adoption issues)
- Expansion velocity slower (longer time-to-expand)

**Corrective Actions for Future Cohorts:**

1. Improve ICP targeting (reduce early churn)
2. Enhance onboarding (increase Day 90 health scores)
3. Proactive expansion (accelerate first expansion)
4. Mid-stage engagement (prevent Month 4-6 drop-off)

**Expected Impact:**
- Target 12-month NRR: 115% (vs. current 108%)
- Target logo retention: 88% (vs. current 83%)
- Target expansion rate: 35% (vs. current 29%)
