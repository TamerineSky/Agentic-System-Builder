description: Update and calibrate lead scoring criteria and thresholds based on conversion data
---

Update lead scoring model based on historical performance.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Current Model Performance**
   - Score distribution analysis
   - Conversion rates by score tier
   - MQL to SQL conversion
   - Sales feedback on lead quality

2. **Scoring Criteria Validation**
   - Which criteria best predict conversion?
   - Over-weighted or under-weighted factors?
   - New signals to incorporate?
   - Disqualifiers working correctly?

3. **Threshold Calibration**
   - Analyze conversion lift by score
   - Optimize MQL threshold (balance volume/quality)
   - Set HQL threshold for urgent followup
   - Adjust based on sales capacity

## Deliverables

### Model Performance Report
- Conversion rates by score tier (0-39, 40-59, 60-79, 80-100)
- Comparison: predicted vs. actual conversion
- False positive/negative analysis
- Sales acceptance rate

### Scoring Adjustments
Recommended changes to:
- Point values by criterion
- MQL/SQL thresholds
- New criteria to add/remove
- Negative scoring updates

### Expected Impact
- Projected MQL volume change
- Projected MQL quality improvement
- Expected SQL conversion rate change

## Data Sources
- HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot (lead scoring data)
- Salesforce (conversion outcomes)
- Sales feedback surveys
