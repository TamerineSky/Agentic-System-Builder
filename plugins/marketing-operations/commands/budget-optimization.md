Optimize marketing budget allocation for maximum ROI.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Current State Assessment**
   - Budget allocation by channel
   - Spend vs. allocated budget
   - Performance by channel (ROI, ROAS, CAC)
   - Budget utilization and pacing

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Calculate ROI by channel
   - Analyze marginal ROI (return on next $1K)
   - Identify saturation points
   - Assess quality metrics (CVR, deal size, sales cycle)

3. **Opportunity Identification**
   - Over-invested channels (low ROI, high spend)
   - Under-invested channels (high ROI, constrained spend)
   - Budget waste (poor targeting, overlap, low-quality traffic)
