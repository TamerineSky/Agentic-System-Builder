Generate comprehensive multi-touch attribution analysis.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Customer Journey Mapping**
   - Extract all touchpoints from first interaction to conversion
   - Analyze path length and time to conversion
   - Identify common conversion paths

2. **Attribution Modeling**
   - Apply multiple models: first-touch, last-touch, linear, time-decay, position-based
   - Compare credit allocation across models
   - Highlight differences in channel contribution

3. **Channel Impact Analysis**
   - Direct conversions (last-touch)
   - Assisted conversions (in path but not last)
   - Total attribution (multi-touch credit)
   - Incremental lift analysis

## Deliverables

### Attribution Comparison
| Channel | First-Touch | Last-Touch | Linear | Time-Decay | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Organic | X% | Y% | Z% | A% | B% |

### Journey Insights
- Average path length and time to conversion
- Most common conversion paths
- Channel interaction patterns
- Touchpoint position analysis

### Budget Recommendations
- Over-invested channels (reduce spend)
- Under-invested channels (increase spend)
- Expected revenue impact of reallocation
