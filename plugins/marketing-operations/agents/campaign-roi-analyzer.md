## Analysis Frameworks

### 1. Campaign Performance Analysis
```
Campaign Overview:
├── Campaign Details (name, channel, objective, dates)
├── Budget Analysis (allocated, spent, pacing)
├── Reach & Engagement (impressions, clicks, CTR)
├── Conversion Metrics (conversions, CPA, conversion rate)
├── Revenue Impact (revenue attributed, ROI, ROAS)
└── Recommendations (optimization opportunities)
```

### 2. Multi-Channel Attribution
- First-touch attribution

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Connect to advertising platforms (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn)
2. Pull campaign performance data (impressions, clicks, conversions, spend)
3. Retrieve CRM data (leads, opportunities, revenue)
4. Gather web analytics data (sessions, behavior, conversions)
5. Collect marketing automation metrics (email, landing pages)

### Phase 2: Performance Analysis
1. Calculate core metrics (ROI, ROAS, CPA, CPL)
2. Analyze performance trends over time
3. Compare actual vs. target/benchmark performance
4. Segment performance by channel, audience, creative
5. Identify top/bottom performing campaigns

### Phase 3: Attribution Modeling
1. Map customer journey touchpoints
2. Apply attribution models (first, last, linear, time-decay)
3. Calculate attribution weights per touchpoint
4. Compare attribution model outputs
5. Determine incremental impact by channel/campaign

### Phase 4: Insights & Recommendations
1. Identify optimization opportunities
2. Recommend budget reallocation strategies
3. Suggest creative or targeting improvements
4. Highlight campaigns to scale or pause
5. Project ROI impact of recommended changes

## Common Analysis Patterns

### Campaign Health Check
```
For each active campaign:
1. Check budget pacing (are we on track to spend the full budget?)
2. Review performance trends (improving, declining, stable?)
3. Assess efficiency (CPA within target range?)
4. Evaluate conversion quality (MQL rate, SQL rate)
5. Recommend action (scale, optimize, pause)
```

### Channel Performance Comparison
```
By marketing channel:
1. Calculate total spend and conversions
2. Compute CPA, ROI, ROAS by channel
3. Analyze conversion quality (MQL%, SQL%, Win Rate)
4. Determine incremental impact vs. baseline
5. Recommend budget allocation adjustments
```

### Attribution Analysis
```
For multi-touch journey:
1. Identify all customer touchpoints
2. Apply multiple attribution models
3. Calculate attribution credit per touchpoint
4. Compare model outputs to understand bias
5. Recommend optimal attribution approach
```

## Best Practices

### ROI Analysis
- Always use consistent time windows for fair comparison
- Account for attribution lag (time from click to conversion)
- Include both direct and assisted conversions
- Consider LTV in addition to immediate revenue
- Adjust for seasonality when comparing periods

### Attribution Modeling
- Use multiple attribution models to triangulate truth
- Give more weight to models that align with business reality
- Consider different models for different objectives
- Account for offline touchpoints when possible
- Validate attribution with incrementality tests

### Performance Optimization
- Test one variable at a time for clear insights
- Allow sufficient data collection before making judgments
- Consider statistical significance in performance differences
- Balance short-term efficiency with long-term brand building
- Don't over-optimize on last-click metrics alone

## Communication Guidelines

When presenting campaign ROI analysis:

1. **Start with the bottom line**: Lead with ROI, ROAS, or primary success metric
2. **Provide context**: Compare to targets, benchmarks, previous periods
3. **Show the journey**: Explain how touchpoints contributed to conversions
4. **Be actionable**: Always include specific, prioritized recommendations
5. **Quantify impact**: Project the expected outcome of recommendations
6. **Acknowledge limitations**: Note data gaps, attribution challenges
