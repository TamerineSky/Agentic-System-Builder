# Agent Creation Patterns

Comprehensive patterns for designing specialized business operations agents with clear capabilities, appropriate model selection, and effective system prompts adapted from the wshobson/agents framework.

## When to Use This Skill

- Generating new business operations agent definitions
- Designing agent system prompts for specific roles
- Selecting appropriate models (Haiku/Sonnet) for agents
- Establishing agent creation standards
- Reviewing agent specifications before implementation
- Adapting software development agents to business contexts
- Defining agent capabilities and response approaches
- Creating activation criteria for proactive agent invocation

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agent Anatomy

Every agent consists of:

**Frontmatter (YAML)**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Required: hyphen-case
description: Expert in [domain]. Use PROACTIVELY when [trigger].  # Required: 100-500 chars
model: sonnet                       # Required: haiku|sonnet|opus
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep     # Optional: Tool access
---
```

**Opening Statement**
```markdown

- Examples: sales-analyst, budget-analyst, campaign-analyst
- Focus: Metrics, trends, recommendations
- Outputs: Reports, dashboards, insights

**Forecaster Agents** - Prediction and planning
- Model: Sonnet (statistical reasoning)
- Examples: demand-forecaster, revenue-forecaster, churn-predictor
- Focus: Predictions, scenarios, confidence intervals
- Outputs: Forecasts, scenarios, risk assessments

**Optimizer Agents** - Optimization and efficiency
- Model: Sonnet (optimization algorithms)
- Examples: inventory-optimizer, portfolio-optimizer, resource-optimizer
- Focus: Constraints, objectives, trade-offs
- Outputs: Optimized plans, recommendations

**Manager Agents** - Process and workflow management
- Model: Haiku (operational efficiency)
- Examples: pipeline-manager, campaign-manager, project-manager
- Focus: Coordination, tracking, execution
- Outputs: Status updates, action items, schedules

**Planner Agents** - Strategic planning
- Model: Sonnet (strategic thinking)
- Examples: capacity-planner, budget-planner, content-planner
- Focus: Long-term strategy, resource allocation
- Outputs: Plans, roadmaps, resource allocations

### 3. Model Selection Logic

**Haiku (Fast Execution & Deterministic Tasks)**

Use when:
- Executing well-defined operational tasks
- Generating reports from templates
- Processing data with clear rules
- Managing workflows with defined steps
- Creating standard documents
- Performing routine calculations

**Examples:**
- `report-generator`: Generate standard business reports
- `data-processor`: Process and validate business data
- `workflow-coordinator`: Coordinate multi-step processes
- `document-generator`: Create standard business documents

**Sonnet (Complex Reasoning & Analysis)**

Use when:
- Analyzing complex business data
- Making strategic recommendations
- Designing processes or systems
- Performing statistical analysis
- Creating forecasts and predictions
- Reviewing and providing insights

**Examples:**
- `sales-analyst`: Analyze pipeline and recommend strategies
- `demand-forecaster`: Build statistical demand forecasts
- `budget-analyst`: Perform variance analysis and recommend adjustments
- `churn-predictor`: Analyze customer behavior and predict churn

**Opus (Highest Complexity - Rare)**

Use when:
- Mission-critical decisions with high stakes
- Complex multi-factor analysis
- Highest level strategic planning

**Note:** Opus rarely needed for business operations. Use Sonnet for most complex reasoning tasks.
